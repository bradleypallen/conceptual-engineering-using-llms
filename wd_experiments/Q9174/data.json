It is celebrated on 25 March each year. In the Catholic Church, if 25 March falls during the Paschal Triduum, it is transferred forward to the first suitable day during Eastertide. In Eastern Orthodoxy and Eastern Catholicism, it is never transferred, even if it falls on Pascha (Easter). The concurrence of these two feasts is called Kyriopascha.\nThe Feast of the Annunciation is observed almost universally throughout Christianity, especially within the Eastern Orthodoxy Church, Anglicanism, the Catholic Church, and Lutheranism.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, because it announces the incarnation of Christ, it is counted as one of the eight great feasts of the Lord. Examples of the importance attached to the Annunciation, especially in the Catholic Church, are the Angelus and the Hail Mary prayers, the event's position as the first Joyful Mystery of the Dominican Rosary, the Novena for the Feast of the Annunciation., and the numerous depictions of the Annunciation in Christian art."}, {"name": "Eid il-Burbara", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q719651", "actual": "positive", "description": "Eid il-Burbara or Saint  Barbara's Day (Arabic: \u0639\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0629), and also called the Feast of Saint Barbara, is a holiday annually celebrated on 17 December (Gregorian calendar) or 4 December (Julian calendar) amongst Middle Eastern Christians in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, and Turkey (Hatay Province).

Tawhid is the religion's central and single most important concept, upon which a Muslim's entire religious adherence rests. It unequivocally holds that God in Islam (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 All\u0101h) is one (Al-\u02beA\u1e25ad) and single (Al-W\u0101\u1e25id).Tawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of submission. The first part of the shahada (the Islamic declaration of faith) is the declaration of belief in the oneness of God. To attribute divinity to anything or anyone else, is shirk \u2013 an unpardonable sin according to the Qur'an, unless repented afterwards. Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.From an Islamic standpoint, there is an uncompromising nondualism at the heart of the Islamic beliefs (aqidah) which is seen as distinguishing Islam from other major religions. Moreover, Tawhid requires Muslims not only to avoid worshiping multiple gods, but also to relinquish striving for money, social status or egoism.The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique, independent and indivisible being, who is independent of the entire creation. God, according to Islam, is a universal God, rather than a local, tribal, or parochial one\u2014God is an absolute, who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.Islamic intellectual history can be understood as a gradual unfolding of the manner in which successive generations of believers have understood the meaning and implications of professing God's Unity. Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it. Islamic theology, jurisprudence, philosophy, Sufism, even to some degree the Islamic understanding of natural sciences, all seek to explain at some level the principle of tawhid.The classical definition of tawhid was limited to declaring or preferring belief in one God and the unity of God. Although the monotheistic definition has persisted into modern Arabic, it is now more generally used to connote \"unification, union, combination, fusion; standardization, regularization; consolidation, amalgamation, merger\".Chapter 112 of the Quran, titled Al-'Ikhl\u0101s (The Sincerity) reads:\n\n"}, {"name": "Mestizo", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q106713", "actual": "positive", "description": "Mestizo (; Spanish: [mes\u02c8tiso] (); fem. mestiza, literally \"mixed person\") is a person of mixed European and indigenous non-European ancestry in the Spanish Empire. In certain regions such as Latin America, it may also refer to people who are culturally European even though their ancestors are indigenous. The term was used as an ethno-racial exonym for mixed-race castas that evolved during the Spanish Empire. It was a formal label for individuals in official documents, such as censuses, parish registers, Inquisition trials, and others. Priests and royal officials might have classified persons as mestizos, but individuals also used the term in self-identification.The noun mestizaje, derived from the adjective mestizo, is a term for racial mixing that did not come into usage until the twentieth century; it was not a colonial-era term. In the modern era, mestizaje is used by scholars such as Gloria Anzald\u00faa as a synonym for miscegenation, but with positive connotations.In the modern era, particularly in Latin America, mestizo has become more of a cultural term, with the term indio being reserved exclusively for people who have maintained a separate Indigenous ethnic and cultural identity, language, tribal affiliation, community engagement, etc. In late 19th- and early 20th-century Peru, for instance, mestizaje denoted those peoples with evidence of Euro-indigenous ethno-racial \"descent\" and access\u2014usually monetary access, but not always\u2014to secondary educational institutions. Similarly, well before the twentieth century, Euramerican \"descent\" did not necessarily denote Iberian American ancestry or solely Spanish American ancestry (distinct Portuguese administrative classification: mesti\u00e7o), especially in Andean regions re-infrastructured by Euramerican \"modernities\" and buffeted by mining labor practices. This conception changed by the 1920s, especially after the national advancement and cultural economics of indigenismo.To avoid confusion with the original usage of the term mestizo, mixed people started to be referred to collectively as castas. In some Latin American countries, such as Mexico, the concept of the Mestizo became central to the formation of a new independent identity that was neither wholly Spanish nor wholly Indigenous. The word mestizo acquired another meaning in the 1930 census, being used by the government to refer to all Mexicans who did not speak Indigenous languages regardless of ancestry. In twentieth- and twenty-first century Peru, the nationalization of Quechuan languages and Aymaran languages as \"official languages of the State...wherever they predominate\" has increasingly severed these languages from mestizaje as an exonym (and, in certain cases, indio), with indigenous languages tied to linguistic areas as well as topographical and geographical contexts. La sierra from the Altiplano to Huascar\u00e1n, for instance, is more commonly connected to language families in both urban and rural vernacular.During the colonial era of Mexico, the category Mestizo was used rather flexibly to register births in local parishes and its use did not follow any strict genealogical pattern. With Mexican independence, in academic circles created by the \"mestizaje\" or \"Cosmic Race\" ideology, scholars asserted that Mestizos are the result of the mixing of all the races. After the Mexican Revolution the government, in its attempts to create an unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions, adopted and actively promoted the \"mestizaje\" ideology."}, {"name": "Etruscan mythology", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q478186", "actual": "positive", "description": "Etruscan religion comprises a set of stories, beliefs, and religious practices of the Etruscan civilization, heavily influenced by the mythology of ancient Greece, and sharing similarities with concurrent Roman mythology and religion.

The worship of these deities, and several others, was found across the Greek world, though they often have different epithets that distinguished aspects of the deity, and often reflect the absorption of other local deities into the pan-Hellenic scheme.\nThe religious practices of the Greeks extended beyond mainland Greece, to the islands and coasts of Ionia in Asia Minor, to Magna Graecia (Sicily and southern Italy), and to scattered Greek colonies in the Western Mediterranean, such as Massalia (Marseille).

These individuals and groups synthesise radical far-right politics with environmentalism and will typically advocate that overpopulation is the primary threat to the environment and that the only solution is to completely halt immigration, or at their most extreme, actively commit genocide against minority groups and ethnicities. As environmentalism has become more and more mainstream in recent decades, many far-right political parties have experimented with adding green politics to their platforms, while since the 2010s a number of terrorists internationally have cited ecofascism as their motive."}, {"name": "Greater Belgium", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1982866", "actual": "negative", "description": "Greater Belgium (French: Grande Belgique) is a Belgian irredentist concept which lays claim on territory nationalists deem as rightfully Belgian.

At the beginning, the movement promoted the annexation to Italy of territories where Italians formed the absolute majority of the population, but retained by the Austrian Empire after the Third Italian War of Independence in 1866. During World  War One the main \"irredent lands\" (terre irredente) were considered to be the provinces of Trento and Trieste and, in a narrow sense, irredentists referred to the Italian patriots living in these two areas. \nThe term was later expanded to also include multilingual and multiethnic areas, where Italians were a relative majority or a substantial minority, within the northern Italian region encompassed by the Alps, with German, Italian, Slovene, Croatian, Ladin and Istro-Romanian population, such as South Tyrol, Istria, Gorizia and Gradisca and part of Dalmatia. The claims were further extended also to the city of Fiume, Corsica, the island of Malta, the County of Nice and Italian Switzerland.\nDuring the Risorgimento in 1860, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, who was leading the unification effort, faced the view of French Emperor Napoleon III who indicated that France would support militarily the Italian unification provided that France was given Nice and Savoy that were held by Sardinia, as France did not want a powerful state having control of the passages of the Alps. As a result, Sardinia ceded Nice and Savoy to France in exchange for France accepting the sending of troops to help the unification of Italy.To avoid confusion and in line with convention, this article uses modern English place names throughout.

Pan-Latinism first rose to prominence in France particularly from the influence of Michel Chevalier (1806\u20131879) who contrasted the \"Latin\" peoples of the Americas with the \"Anglo-Saxon\" peoples there. 19th-century French writer Stendhal spoke of \"Latinism\" as an imperial idea that the Latins should rule over their non-Latin neighbours. It was later adopted by Napoleon III, who declared support for the cultural unity of Latin peoples and presented France as the modern leader of the Latin peoples to justify French intervention in Mexican politics that led to the creation of the pro-French Second Mexican Empire. Sociologist Ren\u00e9 Maunier writes that the medieval Italian poet Dante toyed with the idea of European domination by Latins in his treatise De Monarchia, which celebrated the \"world empire\" of the Romans.In the aftermath of France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and the creation of a state of Germany, the French political theorist Gabriel Hanotaux rejected claims that the era of imperial dominance of the Latin peoples, particularly the French, was over and that the new era was one of imperial dominance of the Anglo-Saxon, Germanic and Slavic peoples. Hanotaux claimed that the Latin peoples had an imperial role to play in colonization of Africa, and that they should have imperial holdings including Africa and South America. The Anglo-Saxon peoples' imperial holdings should be North America, the Germanic peoples should have Central Europe, and the Slavic peoples should have Siberia.A democratic and confederal form of pan-Latinism arose through the influence of Occitan French figure Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mistral, who advocated regional autonomy for Occitania in France. He also advocated pan-Latinism after he had contacted Catalans who supported autonomy of Catalonia alongside Latin unity. Mistral influenced Jean Charles-Brun, whose Le r\u00e9gionalisme, in turn, impressed Mistral. Charles-Brun advocated an international Latinism and the creation of a democratic conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration latine (\"Latin Confederation\") but rejected proposals of a \"Latin Empire\"."}, {"name": "United Slovenia", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1585354", "actual": "negative", "description": "United Slovenia (Slovene: Zedinjena Slovenija or Zdru\u017eena Slovenija) is the name originally given to an unrealized political programme of the Slovene national movement, formulated during the Spring of Nations in 1848.
