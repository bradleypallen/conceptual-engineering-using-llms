It was produced for many years as a state-run initiative. Typically the wine is made from a  blend of Aligot\u00e9 and Chardonnay grapes.\nAfter the Soviet Union dissolved, private corporations in Belarus, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, and Ukraine purchased the rights to use \"Soviet Champagne\" as a brand name and began manufacturing once again. \"Soviet Champagne\" is still being produced today by those private companies, using the original generic title as a brand name."}, {"name": "Amontillado", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2668300", "actual": "negative", "description": "Amontillado (Spanish pronunciation: [amonti\u02c8\u028ea\u00f0o] ah-MON-tee-AH-doe) is a variety of sherry wine characterised by being darker than fino but lighter than oloroso. It is named after the Montilla region of Spain, where the style originated in the 18th century, although the name \"Amontillado\" is sometimes used commercially as a simple measure of colour to label any sherry lying between a fino and an oloroso. It features prominently in the Edgar Allan Poe short story \"The Cask of Amontillado\".\nAn Amontillado sherry begins as a fino, fortified to approximately 15.5% alcohol with a cap of flor yeast limiting its exposure to the air. A cask of fino is considered to be amontillado if the layer of flor fails to develop adequately, is intentionally killed by additional fortification, or is allowed to die off through non-replenishment. Without the layer of flor, amontillado must be fortified to approximately 17.5% alcohol so that it does not oxidise too quickly. After the additional fortification, Amontillado oxidises slowly, exposed to oxygen through the slightly porous American or Canadian oak casks, and gains a darker colour and richer flavour than fino.\nAmontillado is characterized by nutty aromas, tobacco, aromatic herbs and often ethereal, polished notes of oak. The fusion of two different ageing processes gives Amontillado wines a specific flavour."}, {"name": "Beaune wine", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2893254", "actual": "negative", "description": "Beaune wine is produced in the commune of Beaune in the C\u00f4te de Beaune subregion of Burgundy. The appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) Beaune may be used for red and white wine with respectively Pinot noir and Chardonnay as the main grape variety. The production consists of slightly over 85 percent red wine, and slightly less than 15 percent white wine. While there are no Grand cru vineyards within Beaune, there are several well-known and highly regarded Premier cru vineyards, including some that are owned by the large n\u00e9gociant houses in Beaune and produce some of their \"flagship\" wines at the Premier cru level. The AOC was created in 1936.\nIn 2008, there was 411.7 hectares (1,017 acres) of vineyard surface in production for Beaune wine at village and Premier cru level, making Beaune the largest village-named appellation of the C\u00f4te d'Or, just ahead of Gevrey-Chambertin AOC in vineyard size. A total of 15,652 hectolitres of wine were produced in 2008, of which 13,319 hectolitres were red wine and 2,333 hectolitres white wine. Some 357.06 hectares (882.3 acres) of this area was used for the red wines in 2007. The total amount produced corresponds to almost 2.1 million bottles, which included almost 1.8 million bottles of red wine and a little over 300,000 bottles of white wine.\nFor white wines, the AOC regulations allow both Chardonnay and Pinot blanc to be used, but most wines are 100% Chardonnay. The AOC regulations also allow up to 15 percent total of Chardonnay, Pinot blanc and Pinot gris as accessory grapes in the red wines, but this is not practised very often. The allowed base yield is 40 hectoliters per hectare of red wine and 45 hectoliters per hectare for white wine. The grapes must reach a maturity of at least 10.5 percent potential alcohol for village-level red wine, 11.0 percent for village-level white wine and Premier Cru red wine, and 11.5 percent for Premier cru white wine.\nBeaune is also the centre of the Burgundy wine business, with most of the largest n\u00e9gociants located in the town, as well as the Hospices de Beaune, which annually holds a charity wine auction."}, {"name": "Pineau des Charentes", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2095599", "actual": "negative", "description": "Pineau des Charentes, (Pineau Charentais, or simply Pineau) is a regional aperitif of western France, made in the d\u00e9partements of Charente, Charente-Maritime, and (to a lesser extent) Dordogne. While popular within its region of production, it is less well known in other regions of France and somewhat uncommon abroad.\nIt is a fortified wine (mistelle or vin de liqueur), made from either fresh, unfermented grape juice or a blend of lightly fermented grape must, to which a Cognac eau-de-vie is added and then matured.\nPineau is also found as a home-made product in the neighbouring Deux-S\u00e8vres and Vend\u00e9e d\u00e9partements. There is also a similar drink called \"Troussepinette\" that is made in the Vend\u00e9e, which is often flavoured with pine or fruits such as pear. Elsewhere in France analogous drinks are made (Macvin in Jura, Floc de Gascogne in the Armagnac area; there is also Pommeau, similarly made by blending apple juice and apple brandy), but these products are much less well known nationally and internationally than Pineau."}, {"name": "Oloroso", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q2838270", "actual": "negative", "description": "Oloroso (\"scented\" in Spanish) is a variety of fortified wine (sherry) made in Jerez and Montilla-Moriles and produced by oxidative aging. It is normally darker than Amontillado. Oloroso is usually dark and nutty. \nUnlike the fino and Amontillado sherries, in oloroso the flor yeast is suppressed by fortification at an earlier stage. This causes the finished wine to lack the fresh yeasty taste of the fino sherries. Without the layer of flor, the sherry is exposed to air through the slightly porous walls of the American or Canadian oak casks and undergoes oxidative aging. As the wine ages, it becomes darker and stronger and is often left for many decades.\nOloroso sherry is also the base for many of the sweet sherries developed for the international market, such as Bristol Cream, in which oloroso is sweetened and sometimes has the color removed by charcoal filtering to achieve the desired effect."}, {"name": "Vin de liqueur", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7931338", "actual": "negative", "description": "A vin de liqueur is a sweet fortified style of French wine that is fortified with brandy to unfermented grape must.

A vin de liqueur is usually served as an ap\u00e9ritif."}]}}
