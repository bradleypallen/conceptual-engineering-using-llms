The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold. It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 4,000 years. The wide variety of white wines comes from the large number of varieties, methods of winemaking, and ratios of residual sugar. White wine is mainly from \"white\" grapes, which are green or yellow in colour, such as the Chardonnay, Sauvignon blanc and Riesling. Some white wine is also made from grapes with coloured skin, provided that the obtained wort is not stained. Pinot noir, for example, is commonly used to produce champagne. Among the many types of white wine, dry white wine is the most common. More or less aromatic and tangy, it is derived from the complete fermentation of the wort. Sweet wines, on the other hand, are produced by interrupting the fermentation before all the grape sugars are converted into alcohol; this is called Mutage or fortification. The methods of enriching wort with sugar are multiple: on-ripening on the vine, passerillage (straining), or the use of noble rot. Sparkling wines, which are mostly white, are wines where the carbon dioxide from the fermentation is kept dissolved in the wine and becomes gas when the bottle is opened. White wines are often used as an ap\u00e9ritif before a meal, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals. White wines are often considered more refreshing and lighter in both style and taste than the majority of their red wine counterparts. Due to their acidity, aroma and ability to soften meat and deglaze cooking juices, white wines are often used in cooking.", "model_name": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.1}, "data": [{"name": "Alazani (wine)", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4708929", "description": "Alazani wine takes its name from one of Alazani River (Georgian: \u10d0\u10da\u10d0\u10d6\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8, Azerbaijani: Qan\u0131x), which forms part of the Georgian border with Azerbaijan in eastern Georgia, before flowing into the Kura River.

The result is a wine with some of the richness of oloroso and some of the crispness of amontillado. Only about 1\u20132% of the grapes pressed for sherry naturally develop into palo cortado.", "actual": "negative", "predicted": "positive", "rationale": "The definition of white wine states that it is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any color. It does not specify a particular type of grape or a specific method of fermentation, indicating that white wine can be made from a variety of grapes and through various methods. \n\nPalo Cortado, as described, is a variety of sherry that undergoes a process of aging under flor and then oxidatively, similar to the fermentation process described in the definition of white wine. Although the definition does not explicitly state that Palo Cortado is made from the non-coloured pulp of grapes, it does not contradict this either. \n\nFurthermore, the definition of white wine mentions that it can be used as an ap\u00e9ritif, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals, which aligns with the typical uses of sherry, including Palo Cortado. \n\nTherefore, based on the provided definitions, it can be argued that Palo Cortado falls under the category of white wine."}], "confusion_matrix": {"positive": {"positive": 9, "negative": 1}, "negative": {"positive": 6, "negative": 4}}}
