France is one of the largest wine producers in the world, along with Italian, Spanish, and American wine-producing regions. French wine traces its history to the 6th century BCE, with many of France's regions dating their wine-making history to Roman times. The wines produced range from expensive wines sold internationally to modest wines usually only seen within France such as the Margnat wines of the post war period. Two concepts central to the better French wines are the notion of terroir, which links the style of the wines to the locations where the grapes are grown and the wine is made, and the Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) system, replaced by the Appellation d'Origine Prot\u00e9g\u00e9e (AOP) system in 2012. Appellation rules closely define which grape varieties and winemaking practices are approved for classification in each of France's several hundred geographically defined appellations, which can cover regions, villages or vineyards. France is the source of many grape varieties (such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc, Syrah) that are now planted throughout the world, as well as wine-making practices and styles of wine that have been adopted in other producing countries.

It sometimes refers to white wine from the Rhine region (specifically Riesling) and sometimes to all German white wine. The word hock is short for the obsolete word hockamore, an alteration of \"Hochheimer\", derived from the name of the town of Hochheim am Main in Germany. \nThe term seems to have been in use in the 17th century, initially for white wines (predominantly Riesling) from the Rheingau, but in the 18th century it came to be used for any German white wine sold in Britain, to convey some of the then very high prestige of Rheingau wine to (often much) lesser German wines.It seems probable that Queen Victoria's visit in 1850 to Hochheim (in Rheingau) and its vineyards during harvest time contributed to the continued use of the term. By then, those Rheingau wines commanded high prices, on par with, and sometimes higher than, the best wines from Bordeaux and Burgundy, matching and sometimes exceeding them in prestige.\nThere are many vineyards associated with Hocks, such as Hochheimer, R\u00fcdesheimer, Marcobrunner and Johannisberger.", "actual": "negative", "predicted": "negative", "rationale": "Based on the information provided in the definitions, it is not possible to argue that Hock (wine) is a French wine. The definition clearly states that Hock is a British term for German white wine, specifically from the Rhine region or referring to all German white wine. It does not mention any connection to France or French wine production. Therefore, using only the information provided, there is no rationale to assert that Hock (wine) is a French wine."}], "confusion_matrix": {"positive": {"positive": 10, "negative": 0}, "negative": {"positive": 2, "negative": 8}}}
