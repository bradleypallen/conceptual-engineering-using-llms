The same term is also used to describe the plants on which the bananas grow.\nThey include commercially important cultivars like 'Dwarf Cavendish' (1888) and 'Grand Nain' (the \"Chiquita banana\"). Since the 1950s, these cultivars have been the most internationally traded bananas. They replaced the Gros Michel banana (commonly known as Kampala banana in Kenya and Bogoya in Uganda) after it was devastated by Panama disease.\nThey are unable to reproduce sexually, instead being propagated via identical clones. Due to this, the genetic diversity of the Cavendish banana is very low. Combined with the fact the Cavendish is planted in dense chunks in a monoculture without other natural species to serve as a buffer, this means the Cavendish is extremely vulnerable to disease, fungal outbreaks, and genetic mutation, possibly leading to eventual commercial extinction."}, {"name": "Boost (health food)", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4943788", "actual": "negative", "description": "Disambiguation error when retrieving summary"}, {"name": "Picota cherry", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5762629", "actual": "negative", "description": "Picota is the name given to four varieties (cultivars) of sweet cherry grown from Prunus avium L. within the Jerte, Ambroz and La Vera mountain valleys in the north of the province of C\u00e1ceres, in the Autonomous Community of Extremadura, Spain.\nPicota varieties include; \"Ambrun\u00e9s\", \"Pico Lim\u00f3n Negro\", \"Pico Negro\" and \"Pico Colorado\".Picota cherries naturally separate from their stalks when picked, leading them to be referred to as \"stemless\"  or \"stalkless\" cherries.

It is the third largest of the Salmonidae, behind Siberian taimen and Pacific Chinook salmon, growing up to a meter in length. Atlantic salmon are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean and in rivers that flow into it. Most populations are anadromous, hatching in streams and rivers but moving out to sea as they grow where they mature, after which the adults seasonally move upstream again to spawn.When the mature fish re-enter rivers to spawn, they change in colour and appearance. Some populations of this fish only migrate to large lakes, and are \"landlocked\", spending their entire lives in freshwater. Such populations are found throughout the range of the species. Unlike Pacific species of salmon, S. salar is iteroparous, which means it can survive spawning and return to sea to repeat the process again in another year with 5-10% returning to the sea to spawn again. Such individuals can grow to extremely large sizes, although they are rare. The different life stages of the fish are known by many different names in English: alevin, fry, parr and smolt.\nAtlantic salmon is considered a very healthy food and one of the fish with a more refined taste in many cultures. As such it features in numerous popular traditional cuisines and can fetch a higher price than some other fish. It has thus long been the target of recreational and commercial fishing, and this, as well as habitat destruction, has impacted the population in some areas. As a result, the species is the subject of conservation efforts in several countries, which appear to have been somewhat successful since the 2000s. Techniques to farm this species using aquacultural methods have also been developed, and at present it is farmed in great numbers in many places around the world. Although this is now a viable alternative to wild-caught fish, farming methods have attracted criticism from environmentalists."}, {"name": "Roquefort", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q189221", "actual": "negative", "description": "Roquefort is a sheep milk blue cheese from Southern France.

It has a characteristic fragrance and flavor with a taste of butyric acid; the blue veins provide a sharp tang. It has no rind; the exterior is edible and slightly salty. A typical wheel of Roquefort weighs between 2.5 and 3 kg (6 and 7 lb), and is about 10 cm (4 in) thick. Each kilogram of finished cheese requires about 4.5 liters of milk to produce.
