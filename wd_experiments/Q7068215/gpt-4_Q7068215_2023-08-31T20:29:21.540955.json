It is one of the terms used by geographers and landscape historians to classify settlements. It is most accurate with regard to planned settlements: its concept is one in which the houses, even most farmhouses within the entire associated area of land, such as a parish, cluster around a central church, which is close to the village green.  Other focal points can be substituted depending on cultures and location, such as a commercial square, circus, crescent, a railway station, park or a sports stadium. A clustered settlement contrasts with these:\ndispersed settlement linear settlement polyfocal settlement, two (or more) adjacent nucleated villages that have expanded and merged to form a cohesive overall communityA sub-category of clustered settlement is a planned village or community, deliberately established by landowners or the stated and enforced planning policy of local authorities and central governments.", "model_name": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.1}, "data": [{"name": "Bervie, Ontario", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q4895950", "description": "Bervie is an unincorporated place and Compact Rural Community in the municipality of Kincardine, Bruce County in southwestern Ontario, Canada.
