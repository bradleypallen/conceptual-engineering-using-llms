      "Yes, Pamela Anderson is a woman. She has the bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction and her gender markers place her within the dominant ideology of her society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate. She may not experience the same level of subordination as other women, but she does still experience a degree of oppression due to her gender.\n",

She has the bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female's biological role in reproduction, which marks her within the dominant ideology of her society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate.
