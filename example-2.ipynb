While the definition includes the idea of occupying a subordinate social position, it's important to note that this doesn't mean every woman is in a subordinate position in every aspect of life. Elinor Ostrom, for example, was a highly respected and influential scholar in her field. However, she lived in a society where women have historically been marginalized, which fits the broader social context mentioned in the definition.</td>\n",
