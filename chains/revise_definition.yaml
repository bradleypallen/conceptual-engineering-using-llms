    Concept: {label} 
    Definition: {definition}
    Counterexample: {counterexample}
    Rationale: {rationale}

    An opponent has challenged your definition of the concept {label} by 
    identifying {counterexample} as a counterexample that does not fit 
    the definition but, in the judgment of the opponent, is in 
    the extension of the concept. Your opponent has also supplied 
    the above rationale to support their challenge.
  
    Ignore any background knowledge about the concept.
    You may, however, use background knowledge about the counterexample.
    Using the above definition, and only the information in the above definition, 
    provide an argument that provides your reasoning as to why 
    the counterexample is valid.
