       "(i) Catherine the Great is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined to have certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female's biological role in reproduction.

       "(ii) The fact that Catherine the Great has these bodily features would mark her within the dominant ideology of her society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social positions that are in fact subordinate. As a woman in a patriarchal society, Catherine the Great would have been expected to conform to societal norms and expectations placed upon women, which often included occupying subordinate social positions.\n",

Catherine the Great, despite her power and influence as a ruler, would have still faced limitations and challenges due to her gender.\n",

       "Firstly, the definition states that a woman is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined to have certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female's biological role in reproduction. While we do not have specific information about Joyce Carol Oates' bodily features, it is generally assumed that women possess certain physical characteristics associated with their biological role in reproduction. As a result, we can infer that Joyce Carol Oates, as a woman, is regularly observed or imagined to have these bodily features.\n",
       "\n",
       "Secondly, the definition states that having these bodily features marks a person within the dominant ideology of their society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social positions that are in fact subordinate. In the case of Joyce Carol Oates, she is indeed marked by society as someone who should occupy certain social positions. As a female author, she may face challenges or stereotypes that are associated with being a woman in a male-dominated industry. This marks her as someone who is expected to occupy a subordinate position within the literary world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, the definition states that the fact that a person satisfies the first two criteria plays a role in their systematic subordination. In other words, their social position is oppressive along some dimension, and their satisfaction of the first two criteria contributes to this oppression. While we do not have specific information about the dimension of subordination that Joyce Carol Oates may face, it is plausible to argue that as a female author, she may encounter systemic biases or discrimination that contribute to her subordination within the literary world.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, based on the given definition, we can argue that Joyce Carol Oates is a woman because she is regularly observed or imagined to have bodily features associated with females, she is marked by society as someone who should occupy a subordinate social position, and her satisfaction of these criteria likely plays a role in her systematic subordination within the literary world.</td>\n",

       "Given that Sally Hemings is a historical figure and was known to be a woman, it can be inferred that she possessed these bodily features. This is supported by background knowledge about Sally Hemings, which confirms that she was a woman and had the physical characteristics commonly associated with females. \n",

       "Secondly, the definition states that having these bodily features marks an individual within the dominant ideology of their society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social positions that are subordinate. In the case of Sally Hemings, she was a slave and lived in a society where slavery was prevalent. Slavery was a system of social subordination, and as a slave, Sally Hemings occupied a subordinate social position. \n",
