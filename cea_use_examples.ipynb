Catwoman, as a fictional character, does not have a real biological role in reproduction, which makes point (i) difficult to assess. Furthermore, while she is often portrayed as having certain bodily features associated with femininity, her social position within her fictional society varies greatly depending on the interpretation of the character. In some versions, she is a criminal and outcast, while in others she is a hero or anti-hero. This makes it hard to determine whether she occupies a subordinate social position as described in point (ii). Finally, point (iii) involves the systematic subordination and oppression of S, which again is difficult to assess given the varying interpretations of Catwoman's character and role.
