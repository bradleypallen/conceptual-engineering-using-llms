definition: "Red wine is a type of wine made from dark-colored grape varieties. 
The color of the wine can range from intense violet, typical of young wines, 
through to brick red for mature wines and brown for older red wines. 
The juice from most purple grapes is greenish-white, the red color coming 
from anthocyan pigments present in the skin of the grape. Much of the red wine 
production process involves extraction of color and flavor components from the grape skin."
