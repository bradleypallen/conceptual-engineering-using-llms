This suggests that she is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined to have certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction.\n",

       "(ii) The fact that she played in women's leagues and for the England national team and Great Britain internationally, marks her within the dominant ideology of her society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate. This is because women's sports, including football, have historically been seen as less prestigious and less valued than men's sports in many societies.\n",
       "\n",
       "(iii) The fact that she satisfies (i) and (ii) plays a role in her systematic subordination. As a woman in a professional sport, she likely faced challenges and obstacles related to gender inequality, which can be seen as a form of oppression. \n",

Firstly, there is an implicit assumption that Gail Williams has the bodily features associated with a female's biological role in reproduction, as she is referred to with female pronouns. Secondly, her involvement in political theater, specifically in a troupe that satirizes anti-feminist politics, suggests that she is marked within the dominant ideology of her society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate. This is further supported by her role in a show that spoofed anti-feminist politics, which could be seen as a response to the systematic subordination of women. Finally, her position as the director of The WELL, a role that she occupied for nearly two decades, could be seen as a form of systematic subordination, as women in leadership positions often face unique challenges and discrimination. Therefore, based on the provided definition and the information about Gail Williams, it can be argued that Gail Williams is a woman.</td>\n",

Secondly, her features mark her within the dominant ideology of her society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate.
