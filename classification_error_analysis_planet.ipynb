This aligns with part (b) of the definition of a planet. However, the description does not provide sufficient information to confirm whether HD 122430 b meets part (a) of the definition, which requires the celestial body to have sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape. Furthermore, it is also not confirmed whether HD 122430 b is not a star or a satellite of a planet. Therefore, based on the provided information, it cannot be definitively asserted that HD 122430 b is a planet.</td>\n",
