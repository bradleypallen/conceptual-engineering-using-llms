Between 1956 and 1964 she won 14 individual Olympic medals and four team medals. She holds the record for the most Olympic gold medals by a gymnast, male or female, with 9. Her total of 18 Olympic medals was a record for 48 years. She held the record for individual event medals, winning 14 over 52 years.  She is credited with helping to establish the Soviet Union as a dominant force in gymnastics.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nShe was born as Larisa Semyonovna Diriy in the Ukrainian SSR. Her father, Semyon Andreyevich Diriy, left the family when she was 11 months old, and she was raised by her illiterate mother, who worked as a cleaner during the day, and as a watchman during the night. Her father was killed at the Battle of Stalingrad, where he served as a machine gun operator. She first practiced ballet, but turned to gymnastics after her choreographer moved out of Kherson. She graduated from high school in 1953, and moved to Kyiv. She attended the Lenin Polytechnic Institute, and continued her training at the Burevestnik VSS. At the age of 19, she debuted internationally at the 1954 Rome World Championships, winning the gold medal in the team competition.\n\n\n== Gymnastics career ==\nIn 1956, at the age of 21, Latynina made her Olympic debut at the Melbourne Olympic Games. In the all-around event, she fought off stiff competition to win gold. She finished first in the vault, second in the uneven bars hand in the exercise on the floor and fourth in the balancing beam. She also led the Soviet Union in Team Event to victory.[1]\nAfter a very successful World Championships in 1958 (winning five out of six titles despite competing whilst four months pregnant and medaling in every event), Latynina was the favorite for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. In the all-around event, she led the Soviet Union to take the first four places, thereby also securing a win in the team competition by a margin of nine points. Latynina defended her floor title, took silver medals in the balance beam and uneven bars events, and bronze in the vault competition.\nLatynina won all-around titles at the 1962 World Championships, beating V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 of Czechoslovakia. Still the defending World Champion at the 1964 Summer Olympics, she was beaten by \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1 in the all-around competition. Latynina added two more gold medals to her tally, winning the team event and the floor event both for the third time in a row. A silver medal and two bronzes in the other apparatus events brought her total of Olympic medals to eighteen\u2014nine gold medals, five silver, and four bronze. She won a medal in every event in which she competed, except for the 1956 balance beam where she came in fourth.\nLatynina's nine gold medals make her second on the list of most Olympic gold medalists. She held the distinction of having more Olympic medals (either individually or with a team) than anybody, from 1964 until 2012. She is the only woman to have won nine gold medals. She is also the only female athlete who at some point has held the record for most Olympic gold medals. Additionally, within the sport of gymnastics, she is the only woman who has won an all-around medal in more than two Olympiads, the only woman who has won an individual event (floor exercise) in more than two Olympiads, and one of only three women who have won every individual event at either the World Championship or Olympic level. She is the only female gymnast to have twice won team gold, all-around gold, and an event final gold at the same Olympics, having done so in 1956 and four years later, in 1960.\n\n\n== Family ==\nShe was born to Pelageya Anisimovna Barabamyuk (1902\u20131975) and Semyon Andreevich Diriy (1906\u20131943), who died in the Battle of Stalingrad.

Her father died in 1919 when she was 3 years old. At that time, Lemberg (Lw\u00f3w) returned to the reborn Poland and her mother began to educate Krystyna at the Lw\u00f3w acting studio run by the actor Janusz Strachocki. In 1934, she graduated from the gymnasium named Queen Jadwiga in Lw\u00f3w; She passed her secondary school-leaving examination extramural in order to pass the exams to the theater school. After three years of study, in 1937, she graduated from the State Institute of Theater Arts in Warsaw. Soon after, she made her debut at the Grand Theatre in Lw\u00f3w. In 1939, she was engaged to the theater in \u0141uck in Poland (now Lutsk, Ukraine), but after the outbreak of World War II, she returned to Lw\u00f3w, which was under Soviet occupation from October 6, 1939 (read: Soviet invasion of Poland). In 1942 she was sworn in as a soldier of the Home Army. She was a liaison there. She returned to the stage of the Lw\u00f3w theater in 1944 after the Red Army entered the city.

She was also one of the developers of the influential COBOL programming language.\nShe received her B.A. in Mathematics from Mount Holyoke College in 1948 and her M.A. in Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1949.  She received an honorary D.Sc. from Mount Holyoke College in 1978.Sammet was employed by Sperry Gyroscope from 1955 to 1958 where she supervised the first scientific programming group.  From 1958 to 1961, she worked for Sylvania as a staff consultant for programming research and a member of the original COBOL group. She joined IBM in 1961  where she developed FORMAC, the first widely used computer language for symbolic manipulation of mathematical formulas. At IBM she researched the use of restricted English as a programming language and the use of natural language for mathematical programs.  She was Programming Technology Planning Manager for the Federal Systems Division from 1968 to 1974, and was appointed Software Technology Manager in 1979.Sammet founded the ACM Special Interest Committee on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation (SICSAM) in 1965 and was chair of the Special Interest Group on Programming Languages (SIGPLAN).

Jean and her sister, Helen, were born to Harry and Ruth Sammet who were both lawyers. Jean and Helen attended public elementary schools in Manhattan. Sammet had a strong interest in mathematics but was unable to attend the Bronx High School of Science because it did not accept girls. Instead, Sammet attended Julia Richman High School.Sammet chose to enroll at Mount Holyoke College based on the strength of its mathematics program. Sammet majored in mathematics and took education courses, which allowed her to be certified to teach high school mathematics in New York. She minored in political science. After graduating from Mount Holyoke, Sammet pursued graduate studies at the University of Illinois, where she received her MA in 1949. While taking courses toward a Ph.D., she was a teaching assistant in the Mathematics department at the University of Illinois from 1948 to 1951. When Sammet first encountered a computer, in 1949 at the University of Illinois, she was not impressed, considering it an obscene piece of hardware.In 1951, Sammet began looking for a position in education. Sammet was forced to search for positions in New Jersey because New York City was not hiring new teachers. The authorities in New Jersey determined that Sammet was missing two courses from her studies: a course in education and one in the history of New Jersey. Sammet fought this determination, stating that her knowledge of New Jersey history did not strengthen her ability to teach mathematics in high school. This forced Sammet to seek other types of employment.\n\n\n== Work ==\nIn 1951, Sammet took a position at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company as a trainee actuary. She agreed to participate in an in-house training program to learn about punched card accounting machines. Sammet took to the electronic accounting machines, but was unable to work with the machines after her training was complete. She left her position at the insurance office and enrolled at Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D. in mathematics. Sammet worked as a teaching assistant at Barnard College during the 1952-1953 school year before she decided that the academic life was not for her.From 1953 to 1958, Sammet was a mathematician for Sperry Gyroscope in New York. She spent time working on mathematical analysis problems for clients and ran an analog computer. Sammet worked on the Department of the Navy\u2019s submarine program during her time there.

Little-known during her life, she has since been regarded as one of the most important figures in American poetry. Dickinson was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, into a prominent family with strong ties to its community. After studying at the Amherst Academy for seven years in her youth, she briefly attended the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary before returning to her family's home in Amherst. Evidence suggests that Dickinson lived much of her life in isolation. Considered an eccentric by locals, she developed a penchant for white clothing and was known for her reluctance to greet guests or, later in life, even to leave her bedroom. Dickinson never married, and most of her friendships were based entirely upon correspondence.While Dickinson was a prolific writer, her only publications during her lifetime were 10 of her nearly 1,800 poems, and one letter. The poems published then were usually edited significantly to fit conventional poetic rules. Her poems were unique for her era; they contain short lines, typically lack titles, and often use slant rhyme as well as unconventional capitalization and punctuation. Many of her poems deal with themes of death and immortality, two recurring topics in letters to her friends, and also explore aesthetics, society, nature, and spirituality.Although Dickinson's acquaintances were most likely aware of her writing, it was not until after her death in 1886\u2014when Lavinia, Dickinson's younger sister, discovered her cache of poems\u2014that her work became public. Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955. In 1998, The New York Times reported on an infrared technology study revealing that much of Dickinson's work had been deliberately censored to exclude the name \"Susan\". At least eleven of Dickinson's poems were dedicated to her sister-in-law Susan Huntington Gilbert Dickinson, though all the dedications were obliterated, presumably by Todd. These edits work to censor the nature of Emily and Susan's relationship, which many scholars have interpreted as romantic.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\n\n=== Family and early childhood ===\nEmily Elizabeth Dickinson was born at the family's homestead in Amherst, Massachusetts, on December 10, 1830, into a prominent, but not wealthy, family. Her father, Edward Dickinson was a lawyer in Amherst and a trustee of Amherst College. Two hundred years earlier, her patrilineal ancestors had arrived in the New World\u2014in the Puritan Great Migration\u2014where they prospered. Emily Dickinson's paternal grandfather, Samuel Dickinson, was one of the founders of Amherst College. In 1813, he built the Homestead, a large mansion on the town's Main Street, that became the focus of Dickinson family life for the better part of a century. Samuel Dickinson's eldest son, Edward, was treasurer of Amherst College from 1835 to 1873, served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1838\u20131839; 1873) and the Massachusetts Senate (1842\u20131843), and represented Massachusetts's 10th congressional district in the 33rd U.S. Congress (1853\u20131855). On May 6, 1828, he married Emily Norcross from Monson, Massachusetts. They had three children:\n\nWilliam Austin (1829\u20131895), known as Austin, Aust or Awe\nEmily Elizabeth\nLavinia Norcross (1833\u20131899), known as Lavinia or VinnieShe was also a distant cousin to Baxter Dickinson and his family, including his grandson the organist and composer Clarence Dickinson.By all accounts, young Dickinson was a well-behaved girl.

A formally trained photographer, Volcano's work includes installation, performance and film and interrogates the performance of gender on several levels, especially the performance of masculinity and femininity.\n\n\n== Identity ==\nBorn intersex, Volcano developed both male and female characteristics as an adolescent but was raised and socialized as female. Volcano continued to live the first 37 years of their life as a woman, but since then has been living as both male and female. Del LaGrace Volcano (formerly named Della Grace) continues to adopt their true self through their name and gender. After marrying a queer man, Johnny Volcano, Del took on their current name to challenge the \"bi-gendered status quo.\" Johnny has now changed his name while Del kept the surname and passed it on to their two children. Del has been in a partnership with the children's mother, Matilda Wurm since 2006. to which Del refers to themself as a \"MaPa\".\n\n\n== Life and career ==\nPrior to moving to San Francisco when they were nineteen, Volcano attended Allan Hancock College as a student in the Visual Studies program from 1977 to 1979. Volcano earned an MA in Photographic Studies at University of Derby, UK in 1992 after studying photography at the San Francisco Art Institute from 1979 to 1981. Del LaGrace Volcano continues to further adopt their true self through their gender as well as their name.\nVolcano's work complicates understandings of both femininity and masculinity by depicting lesbian masculinity. In \"The Feminine Principle\" Volcano takes queer femininities as a focus; including in this project is a portrait of Kate Bornstein. In \"Lesbian Boyz and Other Inverts,\"  Volcano's celebration of butch dykes, transsexual boys and other gender-queers. In the project, masculinity is shown as a tool of subversion.Volcano's recent photographs demonstrate how intersex bodies can offer an entirely new perspective on the body.  The \u201cnormal\u201d body in relation to Volcano's photographs becomes queer, describing the bodies in their latest works as \"sites of mutation, loss, and longing.\"  In these newer works, Volcano takes on the loss of their friend, Kathy Acker and the transformation of their lover Simo Maronati's abled body into a disabled one.  Here, Volcano illustrates the queerness of any body marked by illness or trauma. Their self-portrait \"INTER*me\" photograph series (formally the \"Herm Body\" series) is a raw rendition of the artist's body using black and white Polaroid film, in conversation with their previous work it speaks to the construction of different age-selves and the technologies of gender in photography.Volcano's artist statement of September 2005 reads:\n\nAs a gender variant visual artist I access 'technologies of gender' in order to amplify rather than erase the hermaphroditic traces of my body. I name myself. A gender abolitionist. A part time gender terrorist and an intentional mutation My journey must be distinguished from the thousands of intersex individuals who have had their 'ambiguous' bodies mutilated and disfigured in a misguided attempt at \"normalization\". I believe in crossing the line, not just once, but as many times as it takes to build a bridge we can all walk across.\nVolcano also explores themes of both sexual and gender fluidity throughout their work. Volcano often depicts the instability of gender identity, by pushing past the binary gender system, and frequently uses their queerness in their work to contest the idea of sexual identity as something that is permanently embodied. As shown in Volcano's photography book, \"Love Bites\", Volcano presents various images of women at sexual play, dressed \"in costumes ranging from brides to gay leather men\". Volcano, in this way, seems to aim at defying conventional gender norms and feminist principles within their text. In Teddy Boy David, Volcano further pushes this agenda and to", "entity": "Del LaGrace Volcano", "in_extension": "False", "rationale": "According to the provided definition, a woman is someone who is observed to have certain female biological features, is marked within their society as someone who should occupy a subordinate social position, and this marking plays a role in their systematic subordination. Del LaGrace Volcano, however, does not fit this definition. They were born intersex and developed both male and female characteristics. Although they were raised and socialized as female, they have been living as both male and female for a significant part of their life. They also actively challenge the binary gender system and use their work to contest the idea of a fixed sexual identity. Therefore, it would be incorrect to categorize Del LaGrace Volcano strictly as a woman."}, {"item": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q16832268", "name": "Bex Taylor-Klaus", "article": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bex_Taylor-Klaus", "gender": "non-binary", "summary": "Rebecca Edison \"Bex\" Taylor-Klaus (born August 12, 1994) is an American actor.

His mother was, Lady Da, came from an elite family of Balhae descent. Emperor Taizu's brother and successor, Emperor Taizong, started a series of wars between the Jin and Song dynasties. During the reign of Emperor Xizong, who succeeded Emperor Taizong, Wanyan Zonggan was described as the most influential man in the Jin imperial court.Digunai, who was an army marshal under Emperor Xizong, overthrew the emperor in a coup d'\u00e9tat in 1150 and replaced him. Having seized the throne through illegitimate means, Digunai was suspicious of other members of the Jurchen aristocracy, and, immediately upon taking the throne, started eliminating potential rivals. He ordered the massacre of the descendants of Emperor Taizong, so as to secure the position of the lineage of Emperor Taizu, to which he belonged.\n\n\n== Reign ==\nDigunai capitalised on the Jin dynasty's \"superior status\" vis-\u00e0-vis the Song dynasty after its victory over the latter in 1141, and sought to make the Jin dynasty the sole Chinese empire. To legitimise himself as a sinicised ruler, in 1150 he lifted Emperor Taizong's prohibition of wearing Han Chinese dress, and adopted an array of Han Chinese practices and institutions, such as holding of sacrificial ceremonies in the northern and southern suburbs of his capital in 1149 (cf. ceremonies conducted at the Temple of Earth and Temple of Heaven in Beijing during the Ming and Qing dynasties), the use of the imperial carriage in 1151, a system of feudal rights in 1156, and the Song dynasty's shan-hu (\u5c71\u547c) style of court ceremonies in 1157. Digunai also introduced the imperial examination system in 1150 and set up the Imperial Academy in the following year. In his pursuit for greater sinicisation and the desire to acquire the Mandate of Heaven, Digunai moved his imperial court from Shangjing (present-day Acheng District, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province to Yanjing (present-day Beijing) in 1153. In 1157, he ordered the destruction of the imperial palaces in Shangjing.In contrast to the traditions of the Tang and Song dynasties, which rarely imposed corporal punishment on the members of the society's educated elites, Digunai continued the Khitan and Jurchen tradition of floggings with gusto, sometimes enjoying personally watching his subjects \u2013 including chancellors, censors, and a princess \u2013 beaten with poles or whips.\n\n\n== Assassination ==\n\nDigunai's attempts to conquer the Southern Song dynasty and unify China under the Jin dynasty's rule ended in failure when his fleet was defeated by Song forces at the battles of Tangdao and Caishi in 1161. Many of his officers defected and in some places the people rebelled against him.

Barbieri went on to write for the sitcoms That's My Bush! and That '80s Show.\n\n\n=== The Big Three ===\nBarbieri was part of a comedy team known as \"The Big Three\" with Perry Caravello and Don Barris. In 2003, the trio starred in the Comedy Central reality movie Windy City Heat, directed by Bobcat Goldthwait and written by Barris and Barbieri, and Jimmy Kimmel. The movie was an elaborate prank on Caravello who was under the impression he had landed his first starring role in a major motion picture.In 2010, Caravello, Barris and Barbieri started a weekly comedy podcast called The Big 3 Podcast, on Adam Carolla's ACE Broadcasting Network. In 2011 the show moved to Barris' own network, before ending in April 2015.\n\n\n=== Jimmy Kimmel Live! ===\nBarbieri began writing for Jimmy Kimmel Live! in 2003, and in 2004 started appearing on the show as the character Jake Byrd.

Byrd usually interacts with the fans while they are being interviewed by the media or inserts himself into press conferences.  He has successfully fooled major media outlets into thinking he is a real person, including The New York Times, who quoted him in a May 1, 2004 article about the Michael Jackson trial, before running a redact five days later noting that he was a character. Despite this, the Times wrote again about him, as if he were a real person, during the 2007 O. J.

During the campaign he became the chaplain of Count Raymond IV of Toulouse, the leader of the Proven\u00e7al army of crusaders. His chronicle, entitled Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem, which he co-wrote with Pons of Balazun, ends with the events immediately following the capture of Jerusalem in 1099.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nRaymond was probably born second half of the 11th century in the vicinity of Toulouse. \"Aguilers\" is probably a reference to the village of Aiguilhe. Before the crusade, Raymond was a lay canon (deacon) of the cathedral of Le Puy. He probably travelled originally in the entourage of Bishop Adhemar of Le Puy, the papal legate. There is a purported charter of Bishop Adhemar that refers to his chancellor as Raymond of Aguilhes, but the existence of this charter and the identification of the chancellor and the canon are doubtful. Raymond was ordained a priest during the Siege of Antioch in 1098 and was made a chaplain to Count Raymond and thus a member of his household after the death of Raymond's previous confessor, Bishop William of Orange. After the successful conquest of Jerusalem he was the likely author of the letter the crusaders wrote to Pope Urban II in 1099.Raymond reports that he was among the first to believe Peter Bartholomew's claim to have seen in a vision the location of the Holy Lance and that he participated in the digging that led to its discovery in the Church of Saint Peter. The authenticity of the Holy Lance and of Peter's visions is a major theme of his work, although he admits that Peter did not unambiguously pass the ordeal by fire in April 1099.\n\n\n== Author of the Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem ==\nEverything we know about Raymond is derived from the Historia, the idea for which he credits to Pons. Raymond must have been the main author and finisher, however, since Pons died before the capture of Jerusalem. The Historia was probably started as the crusade progressed, possibly just after the discovery of the Holy Lance, and the preface added later. It was completed before the death of Count Raymond in 1105.His account is partial to the Peasants' Crusade and takes a dim view of those who deserted or abandoned the expedition (and their vows). He had access to the Gesta Francorum, of which he made some use, and his Historia was used as a source by Fulcher of Chartres for the work he completed in 1101. He was further influenced by his time at the Le Puy Cathedral whose library, including the famous Le Puy Bible, was comparable to some of the best of the late tenth and early eleventh century. \nCompared to other authors of works on the First Crusade, Raymond has a preference for references to the Old instead of the New Testament, using twice as many as his fellow Provencal Peter Tudebode. There are references to several eschatological elements in his account such as the Olivet Discourse, the Last Emperor or Apocalypse of Daniel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nRaymond d'Aguilers, Historia Francorum qui ceperunt Iherusalem tr.

Waldheim was the Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1972 to 1981 and president of Austria from 1986 to 1992. While he was running for the latter office in the 1986 election, the revelation of his service in Greece and Yugoslavia, and participation in Nazi atrocities, as an intelligence officer in Nazi Germany's Wehrmacht during World War II, raised international controversy.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWaldheim was born in Sankt Andr\u00e4-W\u00f6rdern, near Vienna, on 21 December 1918. He was the eldest child of Walter Watzlawik, a schoolmaster of Czech origin, and his wife Josefine Petrasch. Watzlawick (original Czech spelling V\u00e1clav\u00edk) changed his name to \"Waldheim\" that year as the Habsburg monarchy collapsed and eventually rose to become superintendent of schools for the Tulln District, attaining the rank of Regierungsrat (government councillor). Active in the Christian Social Party, he was well regarded as a devoutly Catholic family man. Waldheim and his two younger siblings, a brother, Walther, and a sister, Gerlinde, enjoyed a comfortable middle-class upbringing. From his youth, Waldheim was distinguished by his unusual height of 1.92 m (6 ft 4 in).  As a gymnasium student in Klosterneuburg, he excelled at languages and was a competent violinist in the school orchestra, also enjoying swimming, boating and tennis.Although his father wanted him to study medicine, Waldheim had an aversion to the sight of blood, and had already decided to enter the foreign service. \nIn March 1936, the Schuschnigg government passed a law mandating a period of military service for prospective civil servants. Consequently, following his graduation Waldheim volunteered for a 12-month term of enlistment in the Austrian Army, and was posted to the 1st Dragoon Regiment on his 18th birthday.  In the autumn of 1937, now an army reservist, Waldheim entered the prestigious Consular Academy in Vienna on a scholarship, where he began his studies in law and diplomacy. Along with his family, Waldheim opposed the German annexation of Austria in 1938, and while actively campaigning against it in Vienna was attacked and injured by Austrian Nazis. Following the annexation, Waldheim's father was briefly arrested by the Gestapo and dismissed from his post, while Waldheim's scholarship was cancelled. He managed to continue his studies by working as a Latin and Greek tutor and borrowing funds from relatives.Waldheim applied for membership in the National Socialist German Students' League (NSDStB), a division of the Nazi Party. Shortly thereafter he became a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazi Party's original paramilitary wing.\nOn 19 August 1944, he married Elisabeth Ritschel in Vienna; their first daughter, Lieselotte, was born the following year. A son, Gerhard, and another daughter, Christa, followed.\n\n\n== Military service in World War II ==\nIn early 1941, Waldheim was drafted into the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany, specifically to the Heer (Army), and posted to the Eastern Front where he served as a squad leader. In December, he was wounded but returned to service in 1942. His service from 1942 to 1945 was the subject of international review in 1985 and 1986. In his 1985 autobiography, he claimed that he was discharged from further service at the front and, for the remainder of the war, finished his law degree at the University of Vienna, in addition to marrying in 1944. After publication, documents and witnesses came to light that revealed Waldheim's military service continued until 1945, during which time he rose to the rank of Oberleutnant.\n\n\n=== Service in Yugoslavia and Greece ===\nWaldheim's functions within the staff of German Army's Group E from 1942 until 1945, as determined by the International Commission of Historians, were:\n\nInterpreter and liaison officer with the 5th Alpine Division \n(Ita", "entity": "Kurt Waldheim", "in_extension": "False", "rationale": "Kurt Waldheim does not meet the criteria outlined in the definition for being a woman.
