The published discovery was retracted a few hours later and republished the next day under the correct name of S/2007 S 5.\nIt was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in images taken on 30 May 2007. Once the discovery was made, a search of older Cassini images revealed it in observations from as far back as June 2004. It was first announced on 18 July 2007.\nAnthe is visibly affected by a perturbing 10:11 mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 20 km in semi-major axis on a timescale of about 2 Earth years. The close proximity to the orbits of Pallene and Methone suggests that these moons may form a dynamical family.\nMaterial blasted off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts is thought to be the source of the Anthe Ring Arc, a faint partial ring about Saturn co-orbital with the moon first detected in June 2007.", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788", "label": "Anthe (moon)", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"moon of Saturn\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"S/2007 S 4\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Saturn XLIX\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Anthe\"@en\n", "predicted": "negative", "rationale": "Based on the provided definition of a planet, it is not possible to argue that Anthe (moon) is a planet.

It is the sixtieth confirmed moon of Saturn.The designation S/2007 S 4 was also accidentally and incorrectly used for a different Saturnian satellite discovered later. The published discovery was retracted a few hours later and republished the next day under the correct name of S/2007 S 5.\nIt was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in images taken on 30 May 2007. Once the discovery was made, a search of older Cassini images revealed it in observations from as far back as June 2004. It was first announced on 18 July 2007.\nAnthe is visibly affected by a perturbing 10:11 mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 20 km in semi-major axis on a timescale of about 2 Earth years. The close proximity to the orbits of Pallene and Methone suggests that these moons may form a dynamical family.\nMaterial blasted off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts is thought to be the source of the Anthe Ring Arc, a faint partial ring about Saturn co-orbital with the moon first detected in June 2007.", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788", "label": "Anthe (moon)", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"moon of Saturn\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"S/2007 S 4\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Saturn XLIX\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Anthe\"@en\n", "predicted": "negative", "rationale": "Based on the provided definition, it is not possible to argue that Anthe (moon) is a planet.

This telescope is on the Hawaiian Island of Maui.From September 2003 to September 2005, the XO Telescope detected tens of thousands of bright stars. In that time, McCullough's team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen stars they had previously identified as promising candidates for extrasolar planets.

It is the sixtieth confirmed moon of Saturn.The designation S/2007 S 4 was also accidentally and incorrectly used for a different Saturnian satellite discovered later. The published discovery was retracted a few hours later and republished the next day under the correct name of S/2007 S 5.\nIt was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in images taken on 30 May 2007. Once the discovery was made, a search of older Cassini images revealed it in observations from as far back as June 2004. It was first announced on 18 July 2007.\nAnthe is visibly affected by a perturbing 10:11 mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 20 km in semi-major axis on a timescale of about 2 Earth years. The close proximity to the orbits of Pallene and Methone suggests that these moons may form a dynamical family.\nMaterial blasted off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts is thought to be the source of the Anthe Ring Arc, a faint partial ring about Saturn co-orbital with the moon first detected in June 2007.", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788", "label": "Anthe (moon)", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"moon of Saturn\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"S/2007 S 4\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Saturn XLIX\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q17788>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Anthe\"@en\n", "predicted": "negative", "rationale": "Based on the provided definition, it is not possible to argue that Anthe (moon) is a planet.
