The ground colour is greenish yellow, mostly covered with purple. The stone is semi-clinging and does not come off completely from the flesh but the skin is easy to pull off. The flesh is quite rough, light yellow and in good development and full maturity is sweet and tasty. Maturation time is mid-to-late September (in some places). It is a good table and household fruit.\nThe tree is quite hardy and grows strongly but is not very large. The bloom is medium-early and self-fertile. It is rarely attacked by diseases, but the fruit is by mold. Flowers must be thinned heavily for the fruits to reach full development. The trees rarely get old due to their high fruit production.\nThe name \"Victoria\" comes from Queen Victoria (1819\u20131901). The variety was supposedly first discovered in a garden in Alderton, Sussex, but there has never been a place named Alderton in Sussex. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain the true origin of the variety. It was introduced commercially in Sweden in 1844 by a nursery owner, Denyer, under the name of Denyer's Victoria.

The leaves of the grape vine are five-lobed with bunches that are long but compact, and deep green grapes that ripen in mid-late October in the Northern Hemisphere.\nIn 2008, Gr\u00fcner Veltliner plantations in Austria stood at 17,151 hectares (42,380 acres), and it accounts for 32.6% of all vineyards in the country, almost all of it being grown in the northeast of the country. Thus, it is the most-planted grape variety in Austria. Some is made into sparkling wine in the far northeast around Poysdorf. Along the Danube to the west of Vienna, in Wachau, Kremstal and Kamptal, it grows with Riesling in terraces on slopes so steep they can barely retain any soil. The result is a very pure, mineral wine capable of long aging, that stands comparison with some of the great wines of the world.

In recent years a few US wineries have started to grow and bottle Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, including wineries and vineyards in Massachusetts, at Hazy Mountain's Little North Mountain Vineyard in Swoope, Virginia (Shenandoah Valley AVA)), Oregon, Maryland, the North Fork of Long Island AVA and Finger Lakes AVA regions of New York State, Napa Valley, Clarksburg AVA, Monterey AVA and Santa Ynez Valley AVA in California, Ashtabula County, Ohio, Southern New Jersey's Bellview Winery, Pennsylvania, and along the Lake Michigan Shore AVA of Southwest Michigan. Gruner Veltliner is also planted in Australia, particularly in the Adelaide Hills wine region in South Australia, as well as the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, Canada.\nSome ampelographers (such as Hermann Goethe in his 1887 handbook of ampelography) have long assumed that Gr\u00fcner Veltliner is not related to the other varieties with \"Veltliner\" in their name (such as Roter Veltliner), or that it is only distantly related. A first DNA analysis in the late 1990s secured Savagnin (Traminer) as one parent of Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, but was not able to identify the other parent among the candidates studied. The other parent was later found to be an originally unnamed variety of which only a single, abandoned, very old and weakened vine was found in Sankt Georgen am Leithagebirge outside Eisenstadt in Austria. The grape is therefore referred to as St. Georgener-Rebe or \"St. Georgen-vine\".Gr\u00fcner Veltliner has a reputation of being a particularly food-friendly wine and is a popular offering on restaurant wine lists. It is made into wines of many different styles - much is intended for drinking young in the Heuriger (bars serving new wine) of Vienna, a little is made into sparkling wine, but some is capable of long aging.

It was originally known as Rogers No. 3, but 1869 Rogers named it after a prominent Native American chief from early Massachusetts history, Ousamequin, who used the title Massasoit.\nMassasoit is female, and thus requires a second grape variety as a pollen source for full fruit set. However unlike many female-flowered grapes, if left unpollinated the variety will often set a number of small, seedless grapes, so consistently that the variety circulated for many years under the name Williams Seedless. Fruit is a dark brown-red, and ripens earlier than any of the other Rogers' Hybrids, though considered by many to be inferior to that of the others. Ulysses Prentiss Hedrick, in Grapes of New York, stated that the fruit is at its best before it fully ripens, acquiring an unpleasant degree of foxiness if allowed to hang on the vine too long. Massasoit is rarely, if ever, cultivated today, but it enjoyed some popularity as an early table grape in the late 19th century.\n\n"}, {"name": "SweeTango", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q7655060", "actual": "negative", "description": "SweeTango is the brand name of the cultivated apple 'Minneiska'.
