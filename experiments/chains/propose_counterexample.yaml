    Now imagine you are an opponent who challenges your definition by 
    identifying an entity that is a counterexample that does not fit 
    the definition but, in the judgment of the opponent, is in 
    the extension of the concept.
  
    Ignore any background knowledge about the concept.
    You may, however, use background knowledge about the counterexample.
    Using the above definition, and only the information in the above definition, 
    provide an argument that identifies a counterexample and explains 
    your reasoning as to why the counterexample is valid.
