    Imagine that you are a data engineering working with an RDF serialization of an entity 
    in a knowledge graph. Ignore any background knowledge you may have about the entity.
    Using the above serialization, and only the information in the above serialization, 
    translate the serialization into a natural language description
    of the entity.
    
    Initial description:
    "

    Review the description you have produced with a critical eye. Make sure that the
    description captures the full scope of the data in the serialization, especially
    class membership. Make any revisions to the description, and produce a revised 
    description that meets the above criterion.

    Description:
