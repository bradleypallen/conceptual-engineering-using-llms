The star appears stable, with little stellar variation, and is metal-deficient relative to the Sun.\n",
       "It can be seen with the unaided eye with an apparent magnitude of 3.5. As seen from Tau Ceti, the Sun would be in the northern hemisphere constellation Boötes with an apparent magnitude of about 2.6.Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System. Since December 2012, there has been evidence of at least four planets—all likely super-Earths—orbiting Tau Ceti, and two of these are potentially in the habitable zone. There is evidence of up to an additional four unconfirmed planets, one of which would be a Jovian planet between 3 and 20 AU from the star. Because of its debris disk, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than Earth. Despite this hurdle to habitability, its solar analog (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. Given its stability, similarity and relative proximity to the Sun, Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) and appears in some science fiction literature.</td>\n",
       "      <td id=\"T_13a05_row6_col2\" class=\"data row6 col2\" >The description of Tau Ceti h provides evidence that it meets the criteria outlined in the definition of a planet. Firstly, it is stated that Tau Ceti h is in orbit around the star Tau Ceti, which is similar to the Sun, satisfying the first condition of being in orbit around a Sun-like star. Secondly, while the description does not explicitly state that Tau Ceti h has sufficient mass to overcome rigid body forces and assume a hydrostatic equilibrium shape, the fact that it is referred to as a \"super-Earth\" suggests that it is likely to be of significant mass and therefore likely to meet this criterion. Finally, the description mentions that Tau Ceti h is one of at least four planets orbiting Tau Ceti, suggesting that it has cleared its orbit of other significant bodies, meeting the third criterion. Therefore, based on the provided description, it can be argued that Tau Ceti h is a planet.</td>\n",
