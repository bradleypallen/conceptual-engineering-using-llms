Although it is not specifically stated that DENIS-P J082303.1−491201 b is in orbit around the Sun, it can be inferred from the fact that it orbits a brown dwarf, which is a type of star. Therefore, it meets the first criterion of the definition of a planet.\\n\\nHowever, the description does not provide information on whether DENIS-P J082303.1−491201 b has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium shape, or whether it has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.

If that was the case, the planet would be a red dwarf instead. However, the data was anything but conclusive, and statistically it is extremely unlikely to lie in such a position.

It orbits the star very close, over 2.5 times as close as Mercury orbits the Sun. For this reason it completes one orbit in only 22 days. Unlike true \\\"hot Jupiters\\\" like 51 Pegasi b, HD 6434 b does not have a circular orbit, but rather an eccentric one.The planet HD 6434 b is named Eyeke. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Ecuador, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Eyeke means near in the language spoken by the Indigenous Waorani tribes.By studying observations taken by the Hipparcos astrometric mission, a group of scientists proposed that the planet has an inclination of 179.9° (almost exactly face-on) and a mass of 196 Jupiters. If that was the case, the planet would be a red dwarf instead. However, the data was anything but conclusive, and statistically it is extremely unlikely to lie in such a position. But because the inclination is unknown, so is the true mass of the planet. Still, it is very probable that the object is a true planet.</td>\n",
