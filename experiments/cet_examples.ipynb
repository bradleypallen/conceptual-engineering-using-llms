This implies that Sally Hemings is expected to fulfill certain roles and responsibilities traditionally assigned to women in her society.\n",

       "(iii) The fact that Sally Hemings satisfies both (i) and (ii) plays a role in her systematic subordination. This suggests that along some dimension, Sally Hemings' social position is oppressive, and her conformity to societal expectations of being a woman contributes to this oppression.\n",

Although Caitlyn Jenner was assigned male at birth, she has undergone gender transition procedures, including hormone therapy and gender confirmation surgery, which have resulted in physical changes that align with the bodily features traditionally associated with females.\n",
       "\n",
       "(ii) The fact that Caitlyn Jenner has these bodily features marks her within the dominant ideology of society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social positions that are in fact subordinate. As a transgender woman, Caitlyn Jenner faces societal expectations and prejudices that are often associated with women, including stereotypes and discrimination.\n",

       "(iii) The fact that Caitlyn Jenner satisfies both (i) and (ii) plays a role in her systematic subordination. As a transgender woman, she faces systematic oppression and discrimination based on her gender identity. This oppression is a result of societal norms and expectations that marginalize and subordinate individuals who do not conform to traditional gender roles.\n",
