The definition of a woman requires that the individual is observed or imagined to have certain bodily features associated with the female biological role in reproduction, is marked within their society's dominant ideology as someone who should occupy certain subordinate social positions, and that these factors contribute to their systematic subordination. The information about Didius Julianus does not indicate that he meets any of these criteria. He was a Roman emperor, a position of power, and there is no mention of him having female biological features or being systematically subordinated due to perceived gender. Therefore, based on the provided definition and information, Didius Julianus cannot be argued to be a woman.</td>\n",
