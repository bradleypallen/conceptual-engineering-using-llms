The definition states that a woman is an adult who self-identifies as a woman and understands their gender in terms of Western conceptions of womanness, femaleness, and/or femininity. While the text does not explicitly state that Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar self-identified as a woman, it does refer to her using female pronouns, which suggests that she was recognized as a woman by others. Furthermore, the fact that she was put on trial for serving in the military posing as a man and marrying a woman implies that she was considered a woman by societal standards of her time. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be argued that Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar fits the definition of a woman.</td>\n",
