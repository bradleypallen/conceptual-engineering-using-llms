definition: "S is a woman iff (i) S is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined to have 
certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female’s biological role in reproduction; 
(ii) that S has these features marks S within the dominant ideology of S’s society as someone who 
ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate (and so motivates 
and justifies S’s occupying such a position); and (iii) the fact that S satisfies (I) and (ii) plays 
a role in S’s systematic subordination, that is, along some dimension, S’s social position is oppressive, 
and S’s satisfying (i) and (ii) plays a role in that dimension of subordination"
