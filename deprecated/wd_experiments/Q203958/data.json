It was first discovered by German astronomer Eduard Sch\u00f6nfeld in 1855. The nebula is visible as a hazy patch in a small telescope, while a larger aperture will show a pair of dark nebulae designated Barnard 1 and Barnard 2. It is associated with a dark cloud L1450 (Barnard 205). Estimates of the distance to this nebula range from 980\u20131,140 ly (300\u2013350 pc).This nebula is in the western part of the Perseus molecular cloud and is a young region of very active star formation, being one of the best-studied objects of its type. It contains a fairly typical hierarchy of star clusters that are still embedded in the molecular cloud in which they formed, which are split into two main sub-groups to the north and south. Most of the infrared emission is happening in the southern part of the nebula. A significant portion of the stars seen in the infrared are in the pre-main sequence stage of their evolution.The nebula region has a combined mass of approximately 450 M\u2609, while the cluster contains around 150 stars with a median age of a million years and a combined mass of 100 M\u2609. The average star formation rate is 10\u00d710\u22124 M\u2609 yr\u20131.  Within the nebula are 20 young stellar objects producing outflows, including Herbig\u2013Haro objects, and a total of 95 X-ray sources that are associated with known members of embedded star clusters.

It has the Bayer designation \u03b2 Orionis, which is Latinized to Beta Orionis and abbreviated Beta Ori or \u03b2 Ori. Rigel is the brightest and most massive component \u2013 and the eponym \u2013 of a star system of at least four stars that appear as a single blue-white point of light to the naked eye. This system is located at a distance of approximately 860 light-years (260 pc) from the Sun.\nA star of spectral type B8Ia, Rigel is calculated to be anywhere from 61,500 to 363,000 times as luminous as the Sun, and 18 to 24 times as massive, depending on the method and assumptions used. Its radius is more than seventy times that of the Sun, and its surface temperature is 12,100 K. Due to its stellar wind, Rigel's mass-loss is estimated to be ten million times that of the Sun. With an estimated age of seven to nine million years, Rigel has exhausted its core hydrogen fuel, expanded, and cooled to become a supergiant. It is expected to end its life as a type II supernova, leaving a neutron star or a black hole as a final remnant, depending on the initial mass of the star.\nRigel varies slightly in brightness, its apparent magnitude ranging from 0.05 to 0.18. It is classified as an Alpha Cygni variable due to the amplitude and periodicity of its brightness variation, as well as its spectral type. Its intrinsic variability is caused by pulsations in its unstable atmosphere. Rigel is generally the seventh-brightest star in the night sky and the brightest star in Orion, though it is occasionally outshone by Betelgeuse, which varies over a larger range.\nA triple-star system is separated from Rigel by an angle of 9.5 arc seconds. It has an apparent magnitude of 6.7, making it 1/400th as bright as Rigel. Two stars in the system can be seen by large telescopes, and the brighter of the two is a spectroscopic binary. These three stars are all blue-white main-sequence stars, each three to four times as massive as the Sun. Rigel and the triple system orbit a common center of gravity with a period estimated to be 24,000 years. The inner stars of the triple system orbit each other every 10 days, and the outer star orbits the inner pair every 63 years. A much fainter star, separated from Rigel and the others by nearly an arc minute, may be part of the same star system."}, {"name": "NGC 1999", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q494031", "actual": "positive", "description": "NGC 1999 is a dust-filled bright nebula with a vast hole of empty space represented by a black patch of sky, as can be seen in the photograph.  It is a reflection nebula, and shines from the light of the variable star V380 Orionis. \nIt was previously believed that the black patch was a dense cloud of dust and gas which blocked light that would normally pass through, called a dark nebula. Analysis of this patch by the infrared telescope Herschel (October 9, 2009), which has the capability of penetrating such dense cloud material, resulted in continued black space. This led to the belief that either the cloud material was immensely dense or that an unexplained phenomenon had been detected. \nWith support from ground-based observations done using the submillimeter bolometer cameras on the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment radio telescope (November 29, 2009) and the Mayall (Kitt Peak) and Magellan telescopes (December 4, 2009), it was determined that the patch looks black not because it is an extremely dense pocket of gas, but because it is truly empty. The exact cause of this phenomenon is still being investigated, although it has been hypothesized that narrow jets of gas from some of the young stars in the region punctured the sheet of dust and gas, as well as, powerful radiation from a nearby mature star may have helped to create the hole. Researchers believe this discovery should lead to a better understanding of the entire star forming process.It is located 1,500 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Orion.

It is being formed by a star that has passed through the red giant phase and has ceased nuclear fusion at its core. This star is concealed at the center of the nebula, and is ejecting gas and dust at velocities of up to 200 km/s. The nebula is named after William E. Westbrook, who died in 1975.\nThis nebula began to form about 200 years ago, and primarily consists of molecular gas. The outer part of the nebula is the result of interaction between rapid bipolar outflow and the gas that was ejected when the star was passing through its asymptotic giant branch phase. The lobes are inclined about 24\u00b0 to the line of sight. The energy being radiated\nfrom the nebula consists of scattered light from the star at the core, light being emitted from a compact HII region surrounding the star, and energy from the shock-excited gas in the lobes.The dynamics of the molecular gas envelope can be studied by examining microwave emission-line spectra from carbon monoxide rotational transitions. These spectra show two distinct velocity components.   The narrow cores of the spectral lines show the familiar parabolic profile of a slow (20 km/sec), high optical depth stellar wind from an Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) star.   This material was expelled before the object became a protoplanetary nebula and constitutes the bulk of the nebula's mass.  A second component arising from the far faster post-AGB wind is also visible.   The fast (>190 km/sec) wind component becomes more prominent in higher frequency, higher energy spectral lines, because the fast wind has a higher temperature than the slow AGB wind.The central star is believed to be of spectral class B0 and has 12,200 times the solar luminosity.   The photosphere of this star is now hot enough to have begun ionizing the nebula, and the ionization region is expanding rapidly.   The size and rate of growth indicates that ionization began around the year 1971.  Once a sizeable portion of the nebula has been ionized, it will have become a planetary nebula.  This means the Westbrook Nebula is at a somewhat more advanced evolutionary stage than the Egg Nebula, whose spectral class F5 star has not yet begun to ionize the nebula material.\n\n"}, {"name": "NGC 1435", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q850101", "actual": "positive", "description": "The Merope Nebula (also known as Tempel's Nebula and NGC 1435) is a diffuse reflection nebula in the Pleiades star cluster, surrounding the 4th magnitude star Merope.

The most accepted theory for the activity source is the presence of an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. The mass of the supermassive black hole at the centre of NGC 2985 is estimated to be 160 million (108.2) M\u2609, based on stellar velocity dispersion. The velocity dispersion is anisotropic, and changes with the azimuth. The rotational speed of the galaxy at its effective radius is 222.9 \u00b1 31.2 km/s.NGC 2985 is the brightest member of a galaxy group known as the NGC 2985 group. Other members of the group include NGC 3027, 25 arcminutes away.

Two radio sources have been detected, with the eastern component being the brighter at 1.0 mJy while the fainter source is emitting 0.75 mJy. This radiation is most likely coming from jets of energetic material being ejected by a central black hole.In 1996 it was revealed that this galaxy has a counter-rotating disk; around 20% of the stars in the galaxy are rotating in the opposite direction from the other 80%. The neutral and ionized gas in this galaxy are rotating in the same direction as the counter-rotating disk, and the stars in this group are generally younger than the main stellar population. This disk may have formed as the result of a merger with a gas-rich dwarf galaxy some four billion years ago. Simulations indicate that the counter-rotation of this disk is acting to suppress spiral arm features in the galaxy as a whole. The young, star-forming ring structure is likely the result of collisions between gas clouds rotating in the opposite directions.\n\n"}, {"name": "NGC 232", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q186609", "actual": "negative", "description": "NGC 232 is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Cetus.
