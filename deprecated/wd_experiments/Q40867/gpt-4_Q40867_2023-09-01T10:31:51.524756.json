The term is used in a wide range of scientific fields and industries, where it is often specifically defined. It may also be applied colloquially or figuratively, with a broad sense. Whether something is considered a poison or not may depend on the amount, the circumstances, and what living things are present. Poisoning could be accidental or deliberate, and if the cause can be identified there may be ways to neutralise the effects or minimise the symptoms. In biology, a poison is a chemical substance causing death, injury or harm to organisms or their parts. In medicine, poisons are a kind of toxin that are delivered passively, not actively. In industry the term may be negative, something to be removed to make a thing safe, or positive, an agent to limit unwanted pests. In ecological terms, poisons introduced into the environment can later cause unwanted effects elsewhere, or in other parts of the food chain.", "model_name": "gpt-4", "temperature": 0.1}, "data": [{"name": "BscTx3", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q109149875", "description": "BcsTx3, also known as Kappa-actitoxin-Bsc4a, is a neurotoxin that blocks voltage-gated potassium channel (Kv1/KCNA).

It consists of hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid), as well as a cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The product is notorious for its use by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to murder approximately 1.1 million  people in gas chambers installed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and other extermination camps.Hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas that interferes with cellular respiration, was first used as a pesticide in California in the 1880s. Research at Degesch of Germany led to the development of Zyklon (later known as Zyklon A), a pesticide that released hydrogen cyanide upon exposure to water and heat. It was banned after World War I, when Germany used a similar product as a chemical weapon. Degussa purchased Degesch in 1922. Their team of chemists, which included Walter Heerdt and Bruno Tesch, devised a method of packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The new product was also named Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Uses included delousing clothing and fumigating ships, warehouses, and trains.\nThe Nazis started using Zyklon B in extermination camps in early 1942 to murder prisoners during the Holocaust. Tesch, as well as his deputy executive, Karl Weinbacher, were executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the SS for use on humans.

The Wasp is regarded as the most advanced of these weapons.\nDevelopment began in 1979, with Boeing and Hughes Aircraft as the primary contractors. The specification called for a small missile which could be carried in large numbers by attack aircraft in multiple dispensers - the A-10 was able to carry several 12 round launcher pods.

The definition of poison is a chemical substance that is harmful or lethal to living organisms. The 9M117 Bastion is an anti-tank missile, not a chemical substance. While it is certainly harmful or lethal, it is not in the way defined by the concept of poison. It causes harm through physical destruction rather than chemical interaction with biological systems. Therefore, based on the provided definition, the 9M117 Bastion cannot be considered a poison."}], "confusion_matrix": {"positive": {"positive": 10, "negative": 0}, "negative": {"positive": 2, "negative": 8}}}
