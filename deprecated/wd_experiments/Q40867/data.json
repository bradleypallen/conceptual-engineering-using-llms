It consists of hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid), as well as a cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The product is notorious for its use by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust to murder approximately 1.1 million  people in gas chambers installed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, Majdanek, and other extermination camps.Hydrogen cyanide, a poisonous gas that interferes with cellular respiration, was first used as a pesticide in California in the 1880s. Research at Degesch of Germany led to the development of Zyklon (later known as Zyklon A), a pesticide that released hydrogen cyanide upon exposure to water and heat. It was banned after World War I, when Germany used a similar product as a chemical weapon. Degussa purchased Degesch in 1922. Their team of chemists, which included Walter Heerdt and Bruno Tesch, devised a method of packaging hydrogen cyanide in sealed canisters along with a cautionary eye irritant and one of several adsorbents such as diatomaceous earth. The new product was also named Zyklon, but it became known as Zyklon B to distinguish it from the earlier version. Uses included delousing clothing and fumigating ships, warehouses, and trains.\nThe Nazis started using Zyklon B in extermination camps in early 1942 to murder prisoners during the Holocaust. Tesch, as well as his deputy executive, Karl Weinbacher, were executed in 1946 for knowingly selling the product to the SS for use on humans. Hydrogen cyanide is now rarely used as a pesticide but still has industrial applications.

The Boeing design was unsuccessful, and the USAF selected the Hughes Wasp missile.\nThe AGM-124A was a small weapon with folding wings and fins to reduce storage space within the launcher. It was intended to be launched in large numbers - 10 or more missiles launched nearly simultaneously was envisaged for a typical attack; the name Wasp derived from this \"swarm\" tactic. The missiles would follow a pre-programmed path to the target area before activating a millimeter wave active radar homing to identify and home on a specific target. This high resolution radar was able to distinguish targets even against enemy jamming and high background clutter from the ground.\nTesting of the radar system began in 1981, and the first prototype AGM-124 took place in 1983.

It now is displayed in the treasure vault of the royal Wawel Castle in Krak\u00f3w, as the only preserved part of the medieval Polish crown jewels. The sword is noted for its hilt, decorated with magical formulae, Christian symbols, and floral patterns, as well as for the narrow slit in the blade which holds a small shield with the coat of arms of Poland.  The name of the sword, derived from the Polish word szczerba (\"gap\", \"notch\", or \"chip\") and wrongly its meaning is perceived as \"the Notched Sword\" or \"the Jagged Sword\" (which is included in the sword's legend), though the edges of its blade are straight and smooth. Proper meaning and rendering into English would be \"the Notching/Jagging Sword\" \u2014 as \"a sword that is meant to notch/jag other weapons\".\nThe legend links Szczerbiec with King Boleslaus I the Brave who was said to have chipped the sword by hitting it against the Golden Gate of Kiev during his intervention in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the Golden Gate was only constructed in 1037 and the sword is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation sword by Ladislaus the Short in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands several times during the 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The Soviet Union returned it to Poland in 1928 as part of war reparations for their loss against Poland in the Polish-Soviet war. During the Second World War, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to Krak\u00f3w until 1959.
