The party held or shared the balance of power on several occasions, winning 11 percent of the vote at its peak in 1970, which resulted in it holding five out of the 60 Senate seats. It has never achieved representation in the House of Representatives but, due to Australia's instant-runoff voting system, it remained influential due to its recommendations for preference allocations. With anti-communism as a strong priority, the DLP almost always directed that its voters preference the Liberal Party and Country Party ahead of the ALP, contributing to the electoral dominance of the Coalition during the 1950s and 1960s. The DLP won seats in the state parliaments of Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales.\nIn 1978, the DLP's Victorian branch was dissolved, but was soon revived and continued to contest elections. The DLP had no parliamentary representation for a period of 30 years from 1976 to 2006. DLP candidates were elected to the Victorian Legislative Council in 2006 and 2014, and a single senator was elected in 2010, with a platform focused more on social conservatism. In 2013, the party changed its name to reflect the standard Australian English spelling of \"labour\". In March 2022, the party was federally de-registered by the Australian Electoral Commission after it was unable to prove it had more than the legally required 1,500 members. The party remains registered for state elections in Victoria and territorial elections in the Australian Capital Territory. In November 2022, a DLP candidate was once again elected to the Victorian Legislative Council."}, {"name": "Gr\u00fctli Union", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q683672", "actual": "negative", "description": "The Gr\u00fctli Union (German: Gr\u00fctliverein; French: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Gr\u00fctli) was a political party in Switzerland."}, {"name": "Justice and Truth Alliance", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q664647", "actual": "negative", "description": "The Justice and Truth Alliance (originally in Romanian: Alian\u0163a Dreptate \u015fi Adev\u0103r; or D.A. for short, meaning \"yes\" in Romanian) was a political alliance comprising two political parties in Romania, namely the centre-right liberal National Liberal Party (PNL) and the initially left-wing Democratic Party (PD), which later switched to center-right ideology.Although the National Union PSD+PUR had won the largest number of seats in the Parliament, the Justice and Truth Alliance formed the government from 2004 to 2007 in a coalition with the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR/RMDSZ) and the Conservative Party (PUR), which had changed sides after DA's candidate won the presidential elections."}, {"name": "National Preservation Party", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q674581", "actual": "negative", "description": "National Preservation Party (Icelandic: \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0varnarflokkurinn) was a political party in Iceland."}, {"name": "Social Democratic Party of South Tyrol", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q670650", "actual": "negative", "description": "The Social Democratic Party of South Tyrol (German: Sozialdemokratische Partei S\u00fcdtirols, SPS) was a regionalist social-democratic and Christian-social party of German speakers in South Tyrol, Italy, that was active from 1972 to 1983."}, {"name": "Vlaams Belang", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q682990", "actual": "negative", "description": "Vlaams Belang (Dutch: [\u02c8vla\u02d0ms b\u0259\u02c8l\u0251\u014b], lit.\u2009'Flemish Interest', VB) is a  Flemish nationalist, and right-wing populist political party in the Flemish Region and Brussels Capital Region of Belgium. It is widely considered to be on the political far-right.Vlaams Belang is a rebrand of Vlaams Blok which dissolved after a trial in 2004 condemned the party for racism. After reorganizing itself as Vlaams Belang, the party continued the core philosophy of its predecessor by campaigning on a separatist and Flemish nationalist platform. It also supports maintaining Flemish cultural identity, opposition to multiculturalism, and calls for tougher law and order policies. However, the VB toned down and implemented some changes to the more controversial portions of the former Vlaams Blok statute and has sought to change its image from a radical to a more conservative party by distancing itself from some of its former programs. Nonetheless, most other parties initially continued the cordon sanitaire which was implemented against the former party, effectively blocking the Vlaams Belang from taking part in government at any level. Additionally, attempts on cutting public subsidies specifically for the party were made through the Belgian draining law.\nLike Vlaams Blok, Vlaams Belang was initially popular with the Flemish electorate and was one of the most successful national-populist parties in Europe. However, from 2008 the party experienced a downturn in support and membership which coincided with internal disputes within the party and the rise of the more moderate nationalist New Flemish Alliance which also supports Flemish independence. Under the current leadership of Tom Van Grieken, the VB has begun to regain popular support and made a comeback during the 2019 federal elections. Following the election, there has been some media speculation that the cordon sanitaire on the party may be lifted for the first time."}, {"name": "Liberal Democracy (France)", "@id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q686372", "actual": "negative", "description": "Liberal Democracy (French: D\u00e9mocratie Lib\u00e9rale, DL) was a conservative-liberal political party in France existing between 1997 and 2002.
