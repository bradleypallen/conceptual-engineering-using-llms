# Conceptual Engineering Using Large Language Models

## Overview
In philosophy, *conceptual engineering* is ”the design, implementation, and evaluation of
concepts” [1]. There are a wide range of views as to how conceptual engineering is to be performed, and even about the meaning of the term *concept* itself, but in many instances it is clearly an activity where language processing is a significant element. In recent years, large language models
(LLMs) have emerged as a technology that promises to be of ”substantial value in the
scientific study of language learning and processing” [2]. The Python notebooks in this repository investigate the question of whether or not large language models can be used to support the process of conceptual engineering.
