# Conceptual Engineering Using Large Language Models

## Overview
In philosophy, conceptual engineering is ”the design, implementation, and evaluation of
concepts” [1]. There are a wide range of views as to the proper definition of the term concept
and how conceptual engineering can be performed, but in many instances it is an activity
where language processing is a significant element. In recent years, large language models
(LLMs) have emerged as a technology that has promises to be of ”substantial value in the
scientific study of language learning and processing” [2]. In this paper, we ask the question
”can large language models support the process of conceptual engineering?” We provide two
examples that suggest that large language models can be used to this end.
