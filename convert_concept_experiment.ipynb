Staburags is the name of a character from the Latvian poem Staburags un Liesma, and denotes a rock with symbolic meaning in literature and history.HD 118203 b was discovered in August 2005 in Haute-Provence Observatory in France by Da Silva who used the doppler spectroscopy to look for shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity as the planet orbits the star.\\nIn 2019 the transits of the planet were detected with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite.

This stellar classification places Kepler-80 among the very common, cool, class M stars that are still within their main evolutionary stage, known as the main sequence. Kepler-80, like other red dwarf stars, is smaller than the Sun, and it has both radius, mass, temperatures, and luminosity lower than that of our own star. Kepler-80 is found approximately 1,223 light years from the Solar System, in the stellar constellation Cygnus, also known as the Swan.\\nThe Kepler-80 system has 6 known exoplanets. The discovery of the five inner planets was announced in October 2012, marking Kepler-80 as the first star identified with five orbiting planets. In 2017, an additional planet, Kepler-80g, was discovered by use of artificial Intelligence and deep Learning to analyse data from the Kepler space telescope.  The method used to discover Kepler-80g had been developed by Google, and during the same study another planet was found, Kepler-90i, which brought the total number of known planets in Kepler-90 up to 8 planets.',\n",

The star has a relatively high proper motion, moving across the sky at an estimated 0.328 arc seconds per year along a position angle of 205°.A 2015 survey ruled out the existence of any additional stellar companions at projected distances from 6 to 145 astronomical units.This star has a stellar classification of K3 V, which indicates that it is an ordinary K-type main sequence star. Based upon observation of regular variations in chromospheric activity, it has a rotation period of 36.5±1.6 days. Stellar models give an estimated mass of around 76% of the Sun. It has a slightly lower metallicity than the Sun, and thus has a lower abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is about 4,803 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of an ordinary K-type star.HD 215152 is a candidate for possessing a debris disk—a circumstellar disk of orbiting dust and debris.

It has a mass between 4 and 7 Jupiter masses and a radius from 10 to 30% larger than Jupiter's. It orbits at 68 AU from HR 8799 (or 7 AU inside the inner edge of the dust disk orbiting the star) with an unknown eccentricity and a period of 460 years, and is the outermost known planet in the HR 8799 system.  Along with two other planets orbiting HR 8799, the planet was discovered on November 13, 2008 by Marois et al., using the Keck and Gemini observatories in Hawaii.  These planets were discovered using the direct imaging technique.\\nIn 2009 it was discovered that the Hubble Space Telescope had in fact directly imaged HR 8799 b eleven years earlier, in 1998, suggesting that more exoplanets might be revealed through analysis of HST photographic archives.  Additional precovery images were also obtained by reanalyzing data taken in 2002 at the Subaru Telescope and in 2005 and 2007 at the W.M Keck Observatory \\nBroadband photometry of HR 8799 b shows that it has thicker clouds in its atmosphere than do older, higher surface gravity substellar objects of the same effective temperature.\\nNear infrared H band and K band spectroscopy of HR8799b published in May 2011 indicate a hydrogen rich, dusty atmosphere with disequilibrium CO / CH4 chemistry.Near infrared spectroscopy made with the Palomar Observatory show evidence of ammonia and/or acetylene as well as carbon dioxide, and some methane. In 2015, the signals of water, carbon monoxide and methane were reported in infrared spectra taken at the Keck telescope. However, a reanalysis of the same data in 2018 shows that water and carbon monoxide are present, but that the methane detection may have been spurious. Observations by the James Webb Space Telescope will be capable of confirming or disproving the presence of methane in HR 8799 b's atmosphere.\",\n",

An independent confirmation of the planet was made by the Wide Angle Search for Planets project later that same year.The XO Project team employed the relatively inexpensive XO Telescope, made from commercial equipment, to search for extrasolar planets. This telescope is on the Hawaiian Island of Maui.From September 2003 to September 2005, the XO Telescope detected tens of thousands of bright stars. In that time, McCullough's team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen stars they had previously identified as promising candidates for extrasolar planets. The star XO-1, in particular, was marked as a promising candidate in June 2005. The amateur astronomers observed it from June to July 2005, eventually confirming that a planet-sized object was eclipsing it.

It is also known as Saturn XLIX; its provisional designation was S/2007 S 4. It is named after one of the Alkyonides; the name means flowery. It is the sixtieth confirmed moon of Saturn.The designation S/2007 S 4 was also accidentally and incorrectly used for a different Saturnian satellite discovered later. The published discovery was retracted a few hours later and republished the next day under the correct name of S/2007 S 5.\\nIt was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in images taken on 30 May 2007. Once the discovery was made, a search of older Cassini images revealed it in observations from as far back as June 2004. It was first announced on 18 July 2007.\\nAnthe is visibly affected by a perturbing 10:11 mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 20 km in semi-major axis on a timescale of about 2 Earth years. The close proximity to the orbits of Pallene and Methone suggests that these moons may form a dynamical family.\\nMaterial blasted off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts is thought to be the source of the Anthe Ring Arc, a faint partial ring about Saturn co-orbital with the moon first detected in June 2007.',\n",

In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated Saturn XVII.Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface.The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is much uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed.\",\n",

The exact mass was not known since inclination was not known until TESS detected the planet. This hot Jupiter is unusual since it has relatively high eccentricity of 0.31.The planet HD 118203 b is named Staburags. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaign by Latvia, during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. Staburags is the name of a character from the Latvian poem Staburags un Liesma, and denotes a rock with symbolic meaning in literature and history.HD 118203 b was discovered in August 2005 in Haute-Provence Observatory in France by Da Silva who used the doppler spectroscopy to look for shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity as the planet orbits the star.\\nIn 2019 the transits of the planet were detected with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The host star is one of the brightest stars for transiting planets and HD 118203 b is therefore a good target for follow-up observations.\\n\\n\",\n",

It has an apparent visual magnitude of 8.13, meaning it is too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Parallax measurements provide distance estimates of around 70 light years. The star has a relatively high proper motion, moving across the sky at an estimated 0.328 arc seconds per year along a position angle of 205°.A 2015 survey ruled out the existence of any additional stellar companions at projected distances from 6 to 145 astronomical units.This star has a stellar classification of K3 V, which indicates that it is an ordinary K-type main sequence star. Based upon observation of regular variations in chromospheric activity, it has a rotation period of 36.5±1.6 days. Stellar models give an estimated mass of around 76% of the Sun. It has a slightly lower metallicity than the Sun, and thus has a lower abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is about 4,803 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of an ordinary K-type star.HD 215152 is a candidate for possessing a debris disk—a circumstellar disk of orbiting dust and debris. This finding was made through the detection of an infrared excess at a wavelength of 70 μm by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The detection has a 3σ level of certainty.\\n\\n',\n",

Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.

The team, led by Peter R. McCullough of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, had four amateur astronomers hailing from North America and Europe. An independent confirmation of the planet was made by the Wide Angle Search for Planets project later that same year.The XO Project team employed the relatively inexpensive XO Telescope, made from commercial equipment, to search for extrasolar planets. This telescope is on the Hawaiian Island of Maui.From September 2003 to September 2005, the XO Telescope detected tens of thousands of bright stars. In that time, McCullough's team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen stars they had previously identified as promising candidates for extrasolar planets. The star XO-1, in particular, was marked as a promising candidate in June 2005. The amateur astronomers observed it from June to July 2005, eventually confirming that a planet-sized object was eclipsing it.

It is the sixtieth confirmed moon of Saturn.The designation S/2007 S 4 was also accidentally and incorrectly used for a different Saturnian satellite discovered later. The published discovery was retracted a few hours later and republished the next day under the correct name of S/2007 S 5.\\nIt was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in images taken on 30 May 2007. Once the discovery was made, a search of older Cassini images revealed it in observations from as far back as June 2004. It was first announced on 18 July 2007.\\nAnthe is visibly affected by a perturbing 10:11 mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 20 km in semi-major axis on a timescale of about 2 Earth years. The close proximity to the orbits of Pallene and Methone suggests that these moons may form a dynamical family.\\nMaterial blasted off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts is thought to be the source of the Anthe Ring Arc, a faint partial ring about Saturn co-orbital with the moon first detected in June 2007.',\n",

In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated Saturn XVII.Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface.The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body.

The star has a relatively high proper motion, moving across the sky at an estimated 0.328 arc seconds per year along a position angle of 205°.A 2015 survey ruled out the existence of any additional stellar companions at projected distances from 6 to 145 astronomical units.This star has a stellar classification of K3 V, which indicates that it is an ordinary K-type main sequence star. Based upon observation of regular variations in chromospheric activity, it has a rotation period of 36.5±1.6 days. Stellar models give an estimated mass of around 76% of the Sun. It has a slightly lower metallicity than the Sun, and thus has a lower abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium. The effective temperature of the stellar atmosphere is about 4,803 K, giving it the orange-hued glow of an ordinary K-type star.HD 215152 is a candidate for possessing a debris disk—a circumstellar disk of orbiting dust and debris. This finding was made through the detection of an infrared excess at a wavelength of 70 μm by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The detection has a 3σ level of certainty.\\n\\n',\n",

Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).\\nThe planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings.

The team, led by Peter R. McCullough of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, had four amateur astronomers hailing from North America and Europe. An independent confirmation of the planet was made by the Wide Angle Search for Planets project later that same year.The XO Project team employed the relatively inexpensive XO Telescope, made from commercial equipment, to search for extrasolar planets. This telescope is on the Hawaiian Island of Maui.From September 2003 to September 2005, the XO Telescope detected tens of thousands of bright stars. In that time, McCullough's team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen stars they had previously identified as promising candidates for extrasolar planets. The star XO-1, in particular, was marked as a promising candidate in June 2005. The amateur astronomers observed it from June to July 2005, eventually confirming that a planet-sized object was eclipsing it.

It is also known as Saturn XLIX; its provisional designation was S/2007 S 4. It is named after one of the Alkyonides; the name means flowery. It is the sixtieth confirmed moon of Saturn.The designation S/2007 S 4 was also accidentally and incorrectly used for a different Saturnian satellite discovered later. The published discovery was retracted a few hours later and republished the next day under the correct name of S/2007 S 5.\\nIt was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in images taken on 30 May 2007. Once the discovery was made, a search of older Cassini images revealed it in observations from as far back as June 2004. It was first announced on 18 July 2007.\\nAnthe is visibly affected by a perturbing 10:11 mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 20 km in semi-major axis on a timescale of about 2 Earth years. The close proximity to the orbits of Pallene and Methone suggests that these moons may form a dynamical family.\\nMaterial blasted off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts is thought to be the source of the Anthe Ring Arc, a faint partial ring about Saturn co-orbital with the moon first detected in June 2007.',\n",

The first operational satellites, designated Gonets-D1, were launched on 19 February 1996. After launch, the first three satellites were given military Kosmos designations, a practice which was not continued with the other satellites.Ten operational satellites and two demonstration spacecraft have been placed in orbit. A further three were lost in a launch failure on 27 December 2000. A new series of modernised Gonets satellites, Gonets-D1M, supplement and replace the satellites which are currently in orbit. A single first D1M satellite was launched by a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle on 21 December 2005. A second Gonets-D1M satellite was launched by a Rokot launch vehicle on 8 September 2010.\\n\\n',\n",

However, its orbit is much more distant, which puts this classification into question. It could very well be in a group of its own.\\nThe exact formation mechanism of S/2004 S 24 is unknown, and due to its low eccentricity (0.085) a captured orbit is unlikely.

The Cassini spacecraft observed Tarqeq over 1.5 days on 15–16 January 2014. \\nThe Tarqiupian (Tarqeqian) orbit lies at an inclination of 49.90° (to the ecliptic; 49.77° to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.1081 and a semi-major axis of 17.9106 Gm.

In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated Saturn XVII.Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface.The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is much uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed.\",\n",

It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).\\nThe planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings.

However, key components still need to be found to determine its habitability for life, including an atmosphere and its composition and if liquid water can exist on its surface.\\nAnalysis of three years of data was required to find its signal. NASA’s Kepler telescope detected it using the transit method (in which the dimming effect that a planet causes as it crosses in front of its star is measured), along with four additional planets orbiting much closer to the star (all modestly larger than Earth).

The team, led by Peter R. McCullough of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, had four amateur astronomers hailing from North America and Europe. An independent confirmation of the planet was made by the Wide Angle Search for Planets project later that same year.The XO Project team employed the relatively inexpensive XO Telescope, made from commercial equipment, to search for extrasolar planets. This telescope is on the Hawaiian Island of Maui.From September 2003 to September 2005, the XO Telescope detected tens of thousands of bright stars. In that time, McCullough's team of amateur astronomers studied a few dozen stars they had previously identified as promising candidates for extrasolar planets. The star XO-1, in particular, was marked as a promising candidate in June 2005. The amateur astronomers observed it from June to July 2005, eventually confirming that a planet-sized object was eclipsing it.

Consisting of three formation-flying satellites, it was developed by Airbus Defence and Space and Thales Alenia Space under the management of the CNES for the French defence procurement agency (DGA).\\nLaunched in November 2021, the satellites are expected to reach their final orbit, 700 km from Earth, after a few months and full operational capability by the end of 2022. Their purpose is to allow France to gather data that was previously inaccessible from land, sea, or airborne sensors, and for the French military to more quickly and effectively adapt to new operational scenarios. An all-weather system operational 24/7, the CERES constellation is notably capable of tracking, identifying and mapping enemy radars, air defenses and command centers.The CERES will replace the ELISA demonstrator, a cluster of four satellites that were deorbited in the summer of 2021 after ten years of service.',\n",

It is also known as Saturn XLIX; its provisional designation was S/2007 S 4. It is named after one of the Alkyonides; the name means flowery. It is the sixtieth confirmed moon of Saturn.The designation S/2007 S 4 was also accidentally and incorrectly used for a different Saturnian satellite discovered later. The published discovery was retracted a few hours later and republished the next day under the correct name of S/2007 S 5.\\nIt was discovered by the Cassini Imaging Team in images taken on 30 May 2007. Once the discovery was made, a search of older Cassini images revealed it in observations from as far back as June 2004. It was first announced on 18 July 2007.\\nAnthe is visibly affected by a perturbing 10:11 mean-longitude resonance with the much larger Mimas. This causes its osculating orbital elements to vary with an amplitude of about 20 km in semi-major axis on a timescale of about 2 Earth years. The close proximity to the orbits of Pallene and Methone suggests that these moons may form a dynamical family.\\nMaterial blasted off Anthe by micrometeoroid impacts is thought to be the source of the Anthe Ring Arc, a faint partial ring about Saturn co-orbital with the moon first detected in June 2007.',\n",

The first operational satellites, designated Gonets-D1, were launched on 19 February 1996. After launch, the first three satellites were given military Kosmos designations, a practice which was not continued with the other satellites.Ten operational satellites and two demonstration spacecraft have been placed in orbit. A further three were lost in a launch failure on 27 December 2000. A new series of modernised Gonets satellites, Gonets-D1M, supplement and replace the satellites which are currently in orbit. A single first D1M satellite was launched by a Kosmos-3M launch vehicle on 21 December 2005. A second Gonets-D1M satellite was launched by a Rokot launch vehicle on 8 September 2010.\\n\\n',\n",

Due to its inclination being similar to the four known members of the Gallic group, S/2004 S 24 could belong to the Gallic group. However, its orbit is much more distant, which puts this classification into question. It could very well be in a group of its own.\\nThe exact formation mechanism of S/2004 S 24 is unknown, and due to its low eccentricity (0.085) a captured orbit is unlikely. Nonetheless, S/2004 S 24 orbits in the opposite direction of all other moons in its orbital region, making it unlikely to have survived in this orbit over the entire history of the Solar System.\\n\\n',\n",

The Cassini spacecraft observed Tarqeq over 1.5 days on 15–16 January 2014. \\nThe Tarqiupian (Tarqeqian) orbit lies at an inclination of 49.90° (to the ecliptic; 49.77° to Saturn's equator), with an eccentricity of 0.1081 and a semi-major axis of 17.9106 Gm. Tarqeq orbits in a prograde direction with a period of 894.86 days.\\nTarqeq is the slowest-rotating irregular moon measured by Cassini–Huygens, with a period of about 76.13±0.04 h and a roughly ellipsoidal shape. This is very close to a 1:5 resonance with Titan's orbital period, suggesting that gravitational interactions possibly lock Tarqeq in a mean-motion resonance.It has very similar inclination and semi-major axis as Siarnaq, suggesting that it is a fragment of the latter.\\n\\n\",\n",

In late 1985 it was officially named after Pandora from Greek mythology. It is also designated Saturn XVII.Pandora was thought to be an outer shepherd satellite of the F Ring. However, recent studies indicate that it does not play such a role, and that only Prometheus, the inner shepherd, contributes to the confinement of the narrow ring. It is more heavily cratered than nearby Prometheus, and has at least two large craters 30 kilometres (19 mi) in diameter. The majority of craters on Pandora are shallow as a result of being filled with debris. Ridges and grooves are also present on moon's surface.The orbit of Pandora appears to be chaotic, as a consequence of a series of four 118:121 mean-motion resonances with Prometheus. The most appreciable changes in their orbits occur approximately every 6.2 years, when the periapsis of Pandora lines up with the apoapsis of Prometheus and the moons approach to within about 1,400 kilometres (870 mi). Pandora also has a 3:2 mean-motion resonance with Mimas.From its very low density and relatively high albedo, it seems likely that Pandora is a very porous icy body. There is much uncertainty in these values, however, so this remains to be confirmed.\",\n",
