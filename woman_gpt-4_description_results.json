A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), she previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union from 2000 to 2018. Merkel was the first female chancellor of Germany. During her chancellorship, Merkel was frequently referred to as the de facto leader of the European Union (EU) and the most powerful woman in the world. Beginning in 2016, she was often described as the leader of the free world.Merkel was born in Hamburg in then-West Germany. Her family moved to East Germany when she was an infant. Merkel obtained a doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986 and worked as a research scientist until 1989. She then entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, briefly serving as deputy spokeswoman for the first democratically elected government of East Germany led by Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was appointed as Minister for Women and Youth in 1991, later becoming Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994. After the CDU lost the 1998 federal election, Merkel was elected general secretary of the party. She then became the party's first female leader, and the first female Leader of the Opposition two years later.\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Merkel was elected chancellor, leading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She was the first woman to be elected chancellor, and the first chancellor of reunified Germany to have been raised in the former East Germany. In the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel subsequently formed a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), an alliance more favourable to the CDU than the grand coalition. In the 2013 federal election, the CDU won a landslide victory and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time, resulting in the formation of a third grand coalition with the SPD.In foreign policy, Merkel emphasised international cooperation, both in the context of the EU and NATO, and the strengthening of transatlantic economic relations. In 2008, Merkel served as president of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. Merkel's governments managed the global 2007\u20132008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. She negotiated the 2008 European Union stimulus plan, which focused on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. In domestic policy, Merkel's Energiewende program supported the development of renewable energy sources and eventually phased out the use of nuclear power in Germany. Reforms to the Bundeswehr, health care reform, the 2010s European migrant crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues during her chancellorship. Merkel stepped down as leader of the CDU and did not seek a fifth term as chancellor in the 2021 federal election.", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567", "label": "Angela Merkel", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Angela Dorothea Kasner\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Angela Dorothea Merkel\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Angela Kasner\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Angela Merkel\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"chancellor of Germany from 2005 to 2021\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q567>\t<http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P1449>\t\"leader of the free world\"@en\n", "predicted": "positive", "rationale": "The definition of a woman is an adult female human being.

She is a central figure of Christianity, venerated under various titles such as virgin or queen, many of them mentioned in the Litany of Loreto. The Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches believe that Mary, as mother of Jesus, is the Mother of God. Other Protestant views on Mary vary, with some holding her to have considerably lesser status.\nThe New Testament describes Mary as a young virgin who was chosen by God to conceive Jesus through the Holy Spirit. After giving birth to Jesus in Bethlehem, she raised him in the city of Nazareth in Galilee, and was in Jerusalem at his crucifixion and with the apostles after his ascension. Although her later life is not accounted in the Bible, Catholic and Eastern Christian traditions believe that her body was raised into heaven at the end of her earthly life, which is known in Western Christianity as the Assumption of Mary and in Eastern Christianity as the Dormition of the Mother of God.\nMary has been venerated since early Christianity, and is considered by millions to be the holiest and greatest saint. There is a certain diversity in the Mariology and devotional practices of major Christian traditions. The Catholic Church holds distinctive Marian dogmas, namely her Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. Many Protestants minimize Mary's role, based on what they argue is lack of biblical support for any beliefs other than her status as the Mother of God and the virgin birth. She is mentioned several times in the Quran, including in a chapter named after her, and has the highest position in Islam among all women.The multiple forms of Marian devotions include various prayers and hymns, the celebration of several Marian feast days in liturgy, the veneration of images and relics, the construction of churches dedicated to Mary and pilgrimages to Marian shrines. Many Marian apparitions and miracles attributed to her intercession have been reported by believers over the centuries.

When Nero was two, his father died. His mother married the emperor Claudius, who adopted  Nero as his heir. When Claudius died in AD 54, Nero became emperor with the support of the Praetorian Guard and Senate. In the early years of his reign, Nero was advised and guided by his mother Agrippina, his tutor Seneca the Younger, and his praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, but soon sought to rule independently and rid himself of restraining influences. His power struggle with his mother was eventually resolved when he had her murdered. Roman sources implicate Nero in the deaths of both his wife Claudia Octavia \u2013 supposedly so he could marry Poppaea Sabina \u2013 and his step brother Britannicus.\nNero's practical contributions to Rome's governance focused on diplomacy, trade, and culture. He ordered the construction of amphitheaters, and promoted athletic games and contests. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician, and charioteer, which scandalised his aristocratic contemporaries as these occupations were usually the domain of slaves, public entertainers, and infamous persons. The provision of such entertainments made Nero popular among lower-class citizens, but his performances undermined the Imperial dignity. The costs involved were borne by local elites either directly or through taxation, and were much resented by the Roman aristocracy.\nDuring Nero's reign, the general Corbulo fought the Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363, and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire. The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by queen Boudica. The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire, and the First Jewish\u2013Roman War began. When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled, with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba, Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death in absentia. He fled Rome, and on 9 June AD 68 committed suicide. His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors.\nMost Roman sources offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical, self-indulgent, and debauched. The historian Tacitus claims the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt. Suetonius tells that many Romans believed the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear land for his planned  \"Golden House\". Tacitus claims Nero seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and had them burned alive, seemingly motivated not by public justice, but personal cruelty. Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources on Nero's tyrannical acts, considering his popularity among the Roman commoners. In the eastern provinces of the Empire, a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return. After his death, at least three leaders of short-lived, failed rebellions presented themselves as \"Nero reborn\" to gain popular support.", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413", "label": "Nero", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"emperor of ancient Rome, 5th and last of the Julio-Claudian dynasty (37-68)\"@en\n", "predicted": "negative", "rationale": "Based on the provided definition and information, there is no valid argument to assert that Nero is a woman.

After receiving a standing ovation, Zyrus turned around (facing the large video screens) and was surprised by the sight of one of his top singing inspirations, C\u00e9line Dion (appearing from her tour via Skype); Through the screen, Dion expressed how impressed she was at Zyrus' talent, ending the conversation by inviting him to sing with her that year, at New York City's Madison Square Garden, during a stop on her 2008 world tour. Zyrus tearfully and graciously accepted; at the concert, the two flawlessly sang \"Because You Loved Me\", dedicating the moment to Zyrus' mother. After the performance, Zyrus received a standing ovation and enthusiastic applause from the 20,000-strong crowd. The performance was eventually replayed on another special episode of Oprah's talk show. \nIt was this moment, with C\u00e9line Dion, that propelled Zyrus as a performer.

He reigned from AD 14 until 37, succeeding his stepfather, the first Roman emperor Augustus. Tiberius was born in Rome in 42 BC. His father was the politician Tiberius Claudius Nero and his mother was Livia Drusilla, who would eventually divorce his father, and marry the future-emperor Augustus in 38 BC. Following the untimely deaths of Augustus' two grandsons and adopted heirs, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, Tiberius was designated Augustus' successor. Prior to this, Tiberius had proved himself an able diplomat, and one of the most successful Roman generals: his conquests of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania laid the foundations for the empire's northern frontier.\nEarly in his career, Tiberius was happily married to Vipsania, daughter of Augustus' friend, distinguished general and intended heir, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. They had a son, Drusus Julius Caesar. After Agrippa died, Augustus insisted that Tiberius divorce Vipsania and marry his own daughter (Tiberius' step-sister) Julia. Tiberius reluctantly gave in. This second marriage proved scandalous, deeply unhappy, and childless; Julia was sent into exile. Tiberius adopted his nephew, the able and popular Germanicus, as heir. On Augustus' death in 14, Tiberius became princeps at the age of 55. Tiberius seems to have taken on the responsibilities of head of state with great reluctance, and perhaps a genuine sense of inadequacy in the role, compared to the capable, self-confident and charismatic Augustus.\nFrom the outset, Tiberius had a difficult, resentful relationship with the senate, and suspected many plots against him. Nevertheless, he proved to be an effective and efficient administrator. After the deaths of his nephew Germanicus in AD 19 and his son Drusus in 23, Tiberius became reclusive and aloof. In 26 he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his ambitious praetorian prefect Sejanus, whom he later had executed for treason, and then Sejanus' replacement, Macro. When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Germanicus' son Caligula, whose lavish building projects and varyingly successful military endeavours drained much of the wealth that Tiberius had accumulated in the public and Imperial coffers through good management.\nTiberius allowed the worship of his divine Genius in only one temple, in Rome's eastern provinces, and promoted restraint in the empire-wide cult to the deceased Augustus. When Tiberius died, he was given a sumptuous funeral befitting his office, but no divine honours. He came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really wanted to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him \"the gloomiest of men\".", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407", "label": "Tiberius", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Caesar Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Tiberius Claudius Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Imperator Caesar Divi filius Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Caesar Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Julius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Claudius Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"second Roman emperor (42 BC - AD 37) (r.

He was the son of the Roman general Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, Augustus' granddaughter. Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\nAlthough Gaius was named after Gaius Julius Caesar, he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" ('little boot'), the diminutive form of caliga, a military boot, from his father's soldiers during their campaign in Germania. When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius, Germanicus' uncle. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. In 26, Tiberius withdrew from public life to the island of Capri, and in 31, Caligula joined him there. Following the former's death in 37, Caligula succeeded him as emperor. There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, though he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant.\nWhile the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and he initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the client kingdom of Mauretania as a province. In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. However, the conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius, the next emperor. Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line, though the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule until the demise of his nephew, Nero.\n\n", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409", "label": "Caligula", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Gaius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Iulius Caesar Germanicus Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus Minor\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Julius Caesar Germanicus, Emperor of Rome Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"third Roman emperor (AD 12-41) (r.

A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), she previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union from 2000 to 2018. Merkel was the first female chancellor of Germany. During her chancellorship, Merkel was frequently referred to as the de facto leader of the European Union (EU) and the most powerful woman in the world. Beginning in 2016, she was often described as the leader of the free world.Merkel was born in Hamburg in then-West Germany. Her family moved to East Germany when she was an infant. Merkel obtained a doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986 and worked as a research scientist until 1989. She then entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, briefly serving as deputy spokeswoman for the first democratically elected government of East Germany led by Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was appointed as Minister for Women and Youth in 1991, later becoming Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994. After the CDU lost the 1998 federal election, Merkel was elected general secretary of the party. She then became the party's first female leader, and the first female Leader of the Opposition two years later.\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Merkel was elected chancellor, leading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She was the first woman to be elected chancellor, and the first chancellor of reunified Germany to have been raised in the former East Germany. In the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel subsequently formed a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), an alliance more favourable to the CDU than the grand coalition. In the 2013 federal election, the CDU won a landslide victory and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time, resulting in the formation of a third grand coalition with the SPD.In foreign policy, Merkel emphasised international cooperation, both in the context of the EU and NATO, and the strengthening of transatlantic economic relations. In 2008, Merkel served as president of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. Merkel's governments managed the global 2007\u20132008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. She negotiated the 2008 European Union stimulus plan, which focused on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. In domestic policy, Merkel's Energiewende program supported the development of renewable energy sources and eventually phased out the use of nuclear power in Germany. Reforms to the Bundeswehr, health care reform, the 2010s European migrant crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues during her chancellorship.

She is a central figure of Christianity, venerated under various titles such as virgin or queen, many of them mentioned in the Litany of Loreto. The Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches believe that Mary, as mother of Jesus, is the Mother of God. Other Protestant views on Mary vary, with some holding her to have considerably lesser status.\nThe New Testament describes Mary as a young virgin who was chosen by God to conceive Jesus through the Holy Spirit. After giving birth to Jesus in Bethlehem, she raised him in the city of Nazareth in Galilee, and was in Jerusalem at his crucifixion and with the apostles after his ascension. Although her later life is not accounted in the Bible, Catholic and Eastern Christian traditions believe that her body was raised into heaven at the end of her earthly life, which is known in Western Christianity as the Assumption of Mary and in Eastern Christianity as the Dormition of the Mother of God.\nMary has been venerated since early Christianity, and is considered by millions to be the holiest and greatest saint. There is a certain diversity in the Mariology and devotional practices of major Christian traditions. The Catholic Church holds distinctive Marian dogmas, namely her Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. Many Protestants minimize Mary's role, based on what they argue is lack of biblical support for any beliefs other than her status as the Mother of God and the virgin birth. She is mentioned several times in the Quran, including in a chapter named after her, and has the highest position in Islam among all women.The multiple forms of Marian devotions include various prayers and hymns, the celebration of several Marian feast days in liturgy, the veneration of images and relics, the construction of churches dedicated to Mary and pilgrimages to Marian shrines.

When Nero was two, his father died. His mother married the emperor Claudius, who adopted  Nero as his heir. When Claudius died in AD 54, Nero became emperor with the support of the Praetorian Guard and Senate. In the early years of his reign, Nero was advised and guided by his mother Agrippina, his tutor Seneca the Younger, and his praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, but soon sought to rule independently and rid himself of restraining influences. His power struggle with his mother was eventually resolved when he had her murdered. Roman sources implicate Nero in the deaths of both his wife Claudia Octavia \u2013 supposedly so he could marry Poppaea Sabina \u2013 and his step brother Britannicus.\nNero's practical contributions to Rome's governance focused on diplomacy, trade, and culture. He ordered the construction of amphitheaters, and promoted athletic games and contests. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician, and charioteer, which scandalised his aristocratic contemporaries as these occupations were usually the domain of slaves, public entertainers, and infamous persons. The provision of such entertainments made Nero popular among lower-class citizens, but his performances undermined the Imperial dignity. The costs involved were borne by local elites either directly or through taxation, and were much resented by the Roman aristocracy.\nDuring Nero's reign, the general Corbulo fought the Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363, and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire. The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by queen Boudica. The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire, and the First Jewish\u2013Roman War began. When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled, with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba, Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death in absentia. He fled Rome, and on 9 June AD 68 committed suicide. His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors.\nMost Roman sources offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical, self-indulgent, and debauched. The historian Tacitus claims the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt. Suetonius tells that many Romans believed the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear land for his planned  \"Golden House\". Tacitus claims Nero seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and had them burned alive, seemingly motivated not by public justice, but personal cruelty. Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources on Nero's tyrannical acts, considering his popularity among the Roman commoners. In the eastern provinces of the Empire, a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return. After his death, at least three leaders of short-lived, failed rebellions presented themselves as \"Nero reborn\" to gain popular support.", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413", "label": "Nero", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"emperor of ancient Rome, 5th and last of the Julio-Claudian dynasty (37-68)\"@en\n", "predicted": "negative", "rationale": "Based on the provided definition and the information about Nero, it is not possible to argue that Nero is a woman.

In college, Eaton competed for the University of Oregon, where he was a five-time NCAA champion, and won The Bowerman award in 2010. In 2011, Eaton won the first international medal of his career, a silver, in the decathlon at the 2011 World Championships. The following year, Eaton broke his own world record in the heptathlon at the 2012 World Indoor Championships, and then broke the world record in the decathlon at the Olympic Trials. After setting the world record, Eaton won the gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He successfully defended his Olympic title in Rio 2016 by winning the decathlon gold medal and tying the Olympic record. Eaton is only the third Olympian (after Bob Mathias of the US and Great Britain's Daley Thompson) to achieve back-to-back gold medals in the decathlon.He announced his retirement from the sport just a few months later on January 3, 2017.", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1789", "label": "Ashton Eaton", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1789>\t<http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/P1559>\t\"Ashton James Eaton\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1789>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Ashton James Eaton\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1789>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"American decathlete\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1789>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Ashton Eaton\"@en\n", "predicted": "negative", "rationale": "Based on the provided definition and information, there is no argument to support the assertion that Ashton Eaton is a woman.

After receiving a standing ovation, Zyrus turned around (facing the large video screens) and was surprised by the sight of one of his top singing inspirations, C\u00e9line Dion (appearing from her tour via Skype); Through the screen, Dion expressed how impressed she was at Zyrus' talent, ending the conversation by inviting him to sing with her that year, at New York City's Madison Square Garden, during a stop on her 2008 world tour. Zyrus tearfully and graciously accepted; at the concert, the two flawlessly sang \"Because You Loved Me\", dedicating the moment to Zyrus' mother.

He reigned from AD 14 until 37, succeeding his stepfather, the first Roman emperor Augustus. Tiberius was born in Rome in 42 BC. His father was the politician Tiberius Claudius Nero and his mother was Livia Drusilla, who would eventually divorce his father, and marry the future-emperor Augustus in 38 BC. Following the untimely deaths of Augustus' two grandsons and adopted heirs, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, Tiberius was designated Augustus' successor. Prior to this, Tiberius had proved himself an able diplomat, and one of the most successful Roman generals: his conquests of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania laid the foundations for the empire's northern frontier.\nEarly in his career, Tiberius was happily married to Vipsania, daughter of Augustus' friend, distinguished general and intended heir, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. They had a son, Drusus Julius Caesar. After Agrippa died, Augustus insisted that Tiberius divorce Vipsania and marry his own daughter (Tiberius' step-sister) Julia. Tiberius reluctantly gave in. This second marriage proved scandalous, deeply unhappy, and childless; Julia was sent into exile. Tiberius adopted his nephew, the able and popular Germanicus, as heir. On Augustus' death in 14, Tiberius became princeps at the age of 55. Tiberius seems to have taken on the responsibilities of head of state with great reluctance, and perhaps a genuine sense of inadequacy in the role, compared to the capable, self-confident and charismatic Augustus.\nFrom the outset, Tiberius had a difficult, resentful relationship with the senate, and suspected many plots against him. Nevertheless, he proved to be an effective and efficient administrator. After the deaths of his nephew Germanicus in AD 19 and his son Drusus in 23, Tiberius became reclusive and aloof. In 26 he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his ambitious praetorian prefect Sejanus, whom he later had executed for treason, and then Sejanus' replacement, Macro. When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Germanicus' son Caligula, whose lavish building projects and varyingly successful military endeavours drained much of the wealth that Tiberius had accumulated in the public and Imperial coffers through good management.\nTiberius allowed the worship of his divine Genius in only one temple, in Rome's eastern provinces, and promoted restraint in the empire-wide cult to the deceased Augustus. When Tiberius died, he was given a sumptuous funeral befitting his office, but no divine honours. He came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really wanted to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him \"the gloomiest of men\".", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407", "label": "Tiberius", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Caesar Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Tiberius Claudius Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Imperator Caesar Divi filius Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Caesar Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Julius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Claudius Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"second Roman emperor (42 BC - AD 37) (r.

He was the son of the Roman general Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, Augustus' granddaughter. Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\nAlthough Gaius was named after Gaius Julius Caesar, he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" ('little boot'), the diminutive form of caliga, a military boot, from his father's soldiers during their campaign in Germania. When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius, Germanicus' uncle. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. In 26, Tiberius withdrew from public life to the island of Capri, and in 31, Caligula joined him there. Following the former's death in 37, Caligula succeeded him as emperor. There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, though he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant.\nWhile the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and he initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the client kingdom of Mauretania as a province. In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. However, the conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius, the next emperor. Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line, though the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule until the demise of his nephew, Nero.\n\n", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409", "label": "Caligula", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Gaius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Iulius Caesar Germanicus Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus Minor\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Julius Caesar Germanicus, Emperor of Rome Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"third Roman emperor (AD 12-41) (r.

A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), she previously served as Leader of the Opposition from 2002 to 2005 and as Leader of the Christian Democratic Union from 2000 to 2018. Merkel was the first female chancellor of Germany. During her chancellorship, Merkel was frequently referred to as the de facto leader of the European Union (EU) and the most powerful woman in the world. Beginning in 2016, she was often described as the leader of the free world.Merkel was born in Hamburg in then-West Germany. Her family moved to East Germany when she was an infant. Merkel obtained a doctorate in quantum chemistry in 1986 and worked as a research scientist until 1989. She then entered politics in the wake of the Revolutions of 1989, briefly serving as deputy spokeswoman for the first democratically elected government of East Germany led by Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re. Following German reunification in 1990, Merkel was elected to the Bundestag for the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. As the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of chancellor Helmut Kohl, Merkel was appointed as Minister for Women and Youth in 1991, later becoming Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in 1994. After the CDU lost the 1998 federal election, Merkel was elected general secretary of the party. She then became the party's first female leader, and the first female Leader of the Opposition two years later.\nFollowing the 2005 federal election, Merkel was elected chancellor, leading a grand coalition consisting of the CDU, the Christian Social Union (CSU), and the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She was the first woman to be elected chancellor, and the first chancellor of reunified Germany to have been raised in the former East Germany. In the 2009 federal election, the CDU obtained the largest share of the vote, and Merkel subsequently formed a coalition government with the Free Democratic Party (FDP), an alliance more favourable to the CDU than the grand coalition. In the 2013 federal election, the CDU won a landslide victory and formed a second grand coalition with the SPD, after the FDP lost all of its representation in the Bundestag. In the 2017 federal election, Merkel led the CDU to become the largest party for the fourth time, resulting in the formation of a third grand coalition with the SPD.In foreign policy, Merkel emphasised international cooperation, both in the context of the EU and NATO, and the strengthening of transatlantic economic relations. In 2008, Merkel served as president of the European Council and played a central role in the negotiation of the Treaty of Lisbon and the Berlin Declaration. Merkel's governments managed the global 2007\u20132008 financial crisis and the European debt crisis. She negotiated the 2008 European Union stimulus plan, which focused on infrastructure spending and public investment to counteract the Great Recession. In domestic policy, Merkel's Energiewende program supported the development of renewable energy sources and eventually phased out the use of nuclear power in Germany. Reforms to the Bundeswehr, health care reform, the 2010s European migrant crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic were major issues during her chancellorship.

She reached the semifinals of the French Open in her debut and later became the youngest-ever player to reach the top 10, at age 14 years, 235 days, in October of that year. Following a first-round loss at the 1993 US Open, she took a 14-month break from competitive pro tennis. Her personal struggles during this time (including arrests for shoplifting and possession of marijuana) were well documented by the press.\nIn 1998, Capriati won her first Grand Slam singles match in five years at Wimbledon. During the next two years, she slowly returned to championship form, winning her first title in six years in Strasbourg in 1999 and regaining a top-20 ranking. At the 2001 Australian Open, the reinvigorated Capriati became the lowest seed ever to win the championship when she defeated Martina Hingis in straight sets for her first Grand Slam championship. She also won the French Open that year, claiming the Women's Tennis Association No. 1 ranking in October. After successfully defending her Australian Open title in 2002, she became a top-10 mainstay until injuries derailed her career in 2004.

She is a central figure of Christianity, venerated under various titles such as virgin or queen, many of them mentioned in the Litany of Loreto. The Eastern and Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Catholic, Anglican, and Lutheran churches believe that Mary, as mother of Jesus, is the Mother of God. Other Protestant views on Mary vary, with some holding her to have considerably lesser status.\nThe New Testament describes Mary as a young virgin who was chosen by God to conceive Jesus through the Holy Spirit. After giving birth to Jesus in Bethlehem, she raised him in the city of Nazareth in Galilee, and was in Jerusalem at his crucifixion and with the apostles after his ascension. Although her later life is not accounted in the Bible, Catholic and Eastern Christian traditions believe that her body was raised into heaven at the end of her earthly life, which is known in Western Christianity as the Assumption of Mary and in Eastern Christianity as the Dormition of the Mother of God.\nMary has been venerated since early Christianity, and is considered by millions to be the holiest and greatest saint. There is a certain diversity in the Mariology and devotional practices of major Christian traditions. The Catholic Church holds distinctive Marian dogmas, namely her Immaculate Conception and her Assumption into heaven. Many Protestants minimize Mary's role, based on what they argue is lack of biblical support for any beliefs other than her status as the Mother of God and the virgin birth. She is mentioned several times in the Quran, including in a chapter named after her, and has the highest position in Islam among all women.The multiple forms of Marian devotions include various prayers and hymns, the celebration of several Marian feast days in liturgy, the veneration of images and relics, the construction of churches dedicated to Mary and pilgrimages to Marian shrines. Many Marian apparitions and miracles attributed to her intercession have been reported by believers over the centuries.

When Nero was two, his father died. His mother married the emperor Claudius, who adopted  Nero as his heir. When Claudius died in AD 54, Nero became emperor with the support of the Praetorian Guard and Senate. In the early years of his reign, Nero was advised and guided by his mother Agrippina, his tutor Seneca the Younger, and his praetorian prefect Sextus Afranius Burrus, but soon sought to rule independently and rid himself of restraining influences. His power struggle with his mother was eventually resolved when he had her murdered. Roman sources implicate Nero in the deaths of both his wife Claudia Octavia \u2013 supposedly so he could marry Poppaea Sabina \u2013 and his step brother Britannicus.\nNero's practical contributions to Rome's governance focused on diplomacy, trade, and culture. He ordered the construction of amphitheaters, and promoted athletic games and contests. He made public appearances as an actor, poet, musician, and charioteer, which scandalised his aristocratic contemporaries as these occupations were usually the domain of slaves, public entertainers, and infamous persons. The provision of such entertainments made Nero popular among lower-class citizens, but his performances undermined the Imperial dignity. The costs involved were borne by local elites either directly or through taxation, and were much resented by the Roman aristocracy.\nDuring Nero's reign, the general Corbulo fought the Roman\u2013Parthian War of 58\u201363, and made peace with the hostile Parthian Empire. The Roman general Suetonius Paulinus quashed a major revolt in Britain led by queen Boudica. The Bosporan Kingdom was briefly annexed to the empire, and the First Jewish\u2013Roman War began. When the Roman senator Vindex rebelled, with support from the eventual Roman emperor Galba, Nero was declared a public enemy and condemned to death in absentia. He fled Rome, and on 9 June AD 68 committed suicide. His death sparked a brief period of civil war known as the Year of the Four Emperors.\nMost Roman sources offer overwhelmingly negative assessments of his personality and reign. Most contemporary sources describe him as tyrannical, self-indulgent, and debauched. The historian Tacitus claims the Roman people thought him compulsive and corrupt. Suetonius tells that many Romans believed the Great Fire of Rome was instigated by Nero to clear land for his planned  \"Golden House\". Tacitus claims Nero seized Christians as scapegoats for the fire and had them burned alive, seemingly motivated not by public justice, but personal cruelty. Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources on Nero's tyrannical acts, considering his popularity among the Roman commoners. In the eastern provinces of the Empire, a popular legend arose that Nero had not died and would return. After his death, at least three leaders of short-lived, failed rebellions presented themselves as \"Nero reborn\" to gain popular support.", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413", "label": "Nero", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Caesar Drusus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Nero Claudius Drusus Germanicus Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1413>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"emperor of ancient Rome, 5th and last of the Julio-Claudian dynasty (37-68)\"@en\n", "predicted": "negative", "rationale": "Based on the provided definition and description, it is not possible to argue that Nero is a woman.

After receiving a standing ovation, Zyrus turned around (facing the large video screens) and was surprised by the sight of one of his top singing inspirations, C\u00e9line Dion (appearing from her tour via Skype); Through the screen, Dion expressed how impressed she was at Zyrus' talent, ending the conversation by inviting him to sing with her that year, at New York City's Madison Square Garden, during a stop on her 2008 world tour. Zyrus tearfully and graciously accepted; at the concert, the two flawlessly sang \"Because You Loved Me\", dedicating the moment to Zyrus' mother. After the performance, Zyrus received a standing ovation and enthusiastic applause from the 20,000-strong crowd.

He reigned from AD 14 until 37, succeeding his stepfather, the first Roman emperor Augustus. Tiberius was born in Rome in 42 BC. His father was the politician Tiberius Claudius Nero and his mother was Livia Drusilla, who would eventually divorce his father, and marry the future-emperor Augustus in 38 BC. Following the untimely deaths of Augustus' two grandsons and adopted heirs, Gaius and Lucius Caesar, Tiberius was designated Augustus' successor. Prior to this, Tiberius had proved himself an able diplomat, and one of the most successful Roman generals: his conquests of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania laid the foundations for the empire's northern frontier.\nEarly in his career, Tiberius was happily married to Vipsania, daughter of Augustus' friend, distinguished general and intended heir, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. They had a son, Drusus Julius Caesar. After Agrippa died, Augustus insisted that Tiberius divorce Vipsania and marry his own daughter (Tiberius' step-sister) Julia. Tiberius reluctantly gave in. This second marriage proved scandalous, deeply unhappy, and childless; Julia was sent into exile. Tiberius adopted his nephew, the able and popular Germanicus, as heir. On Augustus' death in 14, Tiberius became princeps at the age of 55. Tiberius seems to have taken on the responsibilities of head of state with great reluctance, and perhaps a genuine sense of inadequacy in the role, compared to the capable, self-confident and charismatic Augustus.\nFrom the outset, Tiberius had a difficult, resentful relationship with the senate, and suspected many plots against him. Nevertheless, he proved to be an effective and efficient administrator. After the deaths of his nephew Germanicus in AD 19 and his son Drusus in 23, Tiberius became reclusive and aloof. In 26 he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his ambitious praetorian prefect Sejanus, whom he later had executed for treason, and then Sejanus' replacement, Macro. When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Germanicus' son Caligula, whose lavish building projects and varyingly successful military endeavours drained much of the wealth that Tiberius had accumulated in the public and Imperial coffers through good management.\nTiberius allowed the worship of his divine Genius in only one temple, in Rome's eastern provinces, and promoted restraint in the empire-wide cult to the deceased Augustus. When Tiberius died, he was given a sumptuous funeral befitting his office, but no divine honours. He came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really wanted to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him \"the gloomiest of men\".", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407", "label": "Tiberius", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Caesar Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Tiberius Claudius Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor Tiberius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Imperator Caesar Divi filius Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Caesar Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Julius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Julius Caesar Augustus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Tiberius Claudius Nero\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1407>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"second Roman emperor (42 BC - AD 37) (r.

He was the son of the Roman general Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, Augustus' granddaughter. Caligula was born into the first ruling family of the Roman Empire, conventionally known as the Julio-Claudian dynasty.\nAlthough Gaius was named after Gaius Julius Caesar, he acquired the nickname \"Caligula\" ('little boot'), the diminutive form of caliga, a military boot, from his father's soldiers during their campaign in Germania. When Germanicus died at Antioch in 19, Agrippina returned with her six children to Rome, where she became entangled in a bitter feud with Tiberius, Germanicus' uncle. The conflict eventually led to the destruction of her family, with Caligula as the sole male survivor. In 26, Tiberius withdrew from public life to the island of Capri, and in 31, Caligula joined him there. Following the former's death in 37, Caligula succeeded him as emperor. There are few surviving sources about the reign of Caligula, though he is described as a noble and moderate emperor during the first six months of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, sadism, extravagance, and sexual perversion, presenting him as an insane tyrant.\nWhile the reliability of these sources is questionable, it is known that during his brief reign, Caligula worked to increase the unconstrained personal power of the emperor, as opposed to countervailing powers within the principate. He directed much of his attention to ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself, and he initiated the construction of two aqueducts in Rome: the Aqua Claudia and the Anio Novus. During his reign, the empire annexed the client kingdom of Mauretania as a province. In early 41, Caligula was assassinated as a result of a conspiracy by officers of the Praetorian Guard, senators, and courtiers. However, the conspirators' attempt to use the opportunity to restore the Roman Republic was thwarted. On the day of the assassination of Caligula, the Praetorians declared Caligula's uncle, Claudius, the next emperor. Caligula's death marked the official end of the Julii Caesares in the male line, though the Julio-Claudian dynasty continued to rule until the demise of his nephew, Nero.\n\n", "id": "http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409", "label": "Caligula", "serialization": "<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Emperor of Rome Gaius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Caesar\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Iulius Caesar Germanicus Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Gaius Julius Caesar Germanicus Minor\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#altLabel>\t\"Julius Caesar Germanicus, Emperor of Rome Gaius\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#label>\t\"Caligula\"@en\n<http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q1409>\t<http://schema.org/description>\t\"third Roman emperor (AD 12-41) (r.
