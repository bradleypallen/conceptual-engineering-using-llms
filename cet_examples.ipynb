       "(iii) The fact that Catherine the Great satisfies both (i) and (ii) plays a role in her systematic subordination. This means that along some dimension, Catherine the Great's social position is oppressive, and her satisfying the criteria of being a woman contributes to that oppression.

This is supported by historical context and background knowledge about the entity Sally Hemings, who was an enslaved woman in the United States during the 18th and 19th centuries.
