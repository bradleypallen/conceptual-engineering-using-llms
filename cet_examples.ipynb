       "(ii) The fact that Rosa Parks has these bodily features marks her within the dominant ideology of her society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social positions that are in fact subordinate. In the context of the civil rights movement in the United States, women, including Rosa Parks, were often seen as subordinate to men in terms of social and political power. The dominant ideology of the time expected women to conform to traditional gender roles and occupy positions that were considered subordinate to those of men.\n",

       "(iii) The fact that Rosa Parks satisfies criteria (i) and (ii) plays a role in her systematic subordination. As a woman in the 1950s, Rosa Parks experienced systematic subordination based on her gender. She faced discrimination and oppression due to societal norms and expectations that limited her opportunities and relegated her to a subordinate social position.\n",

As far as we know, James Earl Carter, also known as former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, does not possess these features. Additionally, the definition requires that the subject occupies a social position that is subordinate within the dominant ideology of their society. While Carter has certainly occupied positions of power and influence, these are not typically considered subordinate. Finally, the definition requires that the subject's social position is oppressive and that their satisfying the first two conditions plays a role in this oppression. Again, this does not apply to Carter. Therefore, based on the provided definition, we cannot argue that James Earl Carter is a woman.</td>\n",
